<span class="smcap">HENRY, KING.</span></h3>


<p>Henry IV. died at Westminster on Monday, March 20, 1413, and Henry of
Monmouth's proclamation bears date on the morrow, March
21.<a id="notetag001" name="notetag001"></a><a href="#note001">[1]</a> Never
perhaps was the accession of any prince to the throne of a kingdom
hailed with a more general or enthusiastic welcome. If serious minds
had <span class="pagenum"><a id="page002" name="page002">(p. 002)</a></span>
entertained forebodings of evil from his reign, (as we
believe they had not,) all feelings seem to have been absorbed in one
burst of gladness. Both houses of parliament offered to swear
allegiance to him before he was crowned: a testimony of confidence and
affection never (it is said) before tendered to any English
monarch.<a id="notetag002" name="notetag002"></a><a href="#note002">[2]</a> This prevalence of joyous anticipations from the accession
of their young King could not have sprung from any change of conduct
or of principle then first made known. Those who charge Henry most
unsparingly represent his conversion as having begun only at his
father's hour of dissolution. But, before that father breathed his
last, the people of England were ready to welcome most heartily his
son, such as he was then, without, as it should seem,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page003" name="page003">(p. 003)</a></span>
either
hearing of, or wishing for, any change. His principles and his conduct
as a ruler had been put to the test during the time he had presided at
the council-board; and the people only desired in their new King a
continuance of the same wisdom, valour, justice, integrity, and
kind-heartedness, which had so much endeared him to the nation as
their Prince. In his subjects there appears to have been room for
nothing but exultation; in the new King himself widely different
feelings prevailed. Ever, as it should seem, under an awful practical
sense, as well of the Almighty's presence and providence and majesty,
as of his own responsibility and unworthiness, Henry seems to have
been suddenly oppressed by the increased solemnity and weight of the
new duties which he found himself now called upon to discharge. The
scene of his father's death-bed, (carried off, as that monarch was, in
the very meridian of life, by a lingering loathsome disease,) and the
dying injunctions of that father, may doubtless have added much to the
acuteness and the depth of his feelings at that time. And whether he
be deemed to have been the licentious, reckless rioter which some
writers have been anxious to describe, or whether we regard him as a
sincere believer, comparing his past life (though neither licentious
nor reckless) with the perfectness of the divine law, the retrospect
might well depress him with a consciousness of his own unworthiness,
and of his total inability
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page004" name="page004">(p. 004)</a></span>
to perform the work which he saw
before him, without the strength and guidance of divine grace. For
that strength and that guidance, we are assured, he prayed, and
laboured, and watched with all the intenseness and perseverance of an
humble faithful Christian. Those who are familiar with the expressions
of a contrite soul, will fully understand the sentiments recorded of
Henry of Monmouth at this season of his self-humiliation, and the
dedication of himself to God, and may yet be far from discovering in
them conclusive arguments in proof of his having passed his youth in
habits of gross violation of religious and moral principle. We have
already quoted the assertions of his biographer, that day and night he
sought pardon for the past, and grace for the future, to enable him to
bend his heart in faith and obedience to the Sovereign of all. And
even during the splendour and rejoicings of his coronation he appeared
to withdraw his mind entirely from the greatness of his worldly state,
thus forced upon him, and to fix his thoughts on the King of
kings.<a id="notetag003" name="notetag003"></a><a href="#note003">[3]</a></p>

<p>But he never seems for a day to have been drawn aside by his private
devotions from the full discharge of the practical duties of his new
station. On the Wednesday he issued summonses for a parliament to meet
within three weeks of Easter. On Friday the 7th of April, he was
conducted to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page005" name="page005">(p. 005)</a></span>
the Tower by a large body of men of London, who
went on horseback to attend him. The next day he was accompanied back
to Westminster, with every demonstration of loyalty and devotedness to
his person, by a great concourse of lords and knights, many of whom he
had created on the preceding evening. On the following morning, being
Passion Sunday, April
9th,<a id="notetag004" name="notetag004"></a><a href="#note004">[4]</a>
he was crowned with
much<a id="notetag005" name="notetag005"></a><a href="#note005">[5]</a> magnificence
in Westminster
Abbey.<a id="notetag006" name="notetag006"></a><a href="#note006">[6]</a></p>

<p>One of the first acts of a sovereign in England at that time was to
re-appoint the judges who were in office at the demise of his
predecessor, or to constitute new ones in their stead. Among other
changes, we find Hankford appointed as Chief Justice in the room of
Gascoyne, at least within ten days of the King's accession. For any
observation which this fact may suggest, so contrary to those
histories which repeat tales instead of seeking for the truth in
ancient records, we must refer to the chapter in which we have already
examined the credibility of the alleged insult offered by Prince Henry
to a Judge on the bench of
justice.<a id="notetag007" name="notetag007"></a><a href="#note007">[7]</a></p>

<p>The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page006" name="page006">(p. 006)</a></span>
first parliament of Henry V. met in the Painted Chamber
at Westminster, on Monday, 15th of May. The King was on his throne;
but the Bishop of Winchester, his uncle, then Chancellor of England,
opened the business of the session. On this, as on many similar
occasions, the chancellor, generally a prelate, addressed the
assembled states in an oration, half speech and half sermon, upon a
passage of Scripture selected as a text. On the opening of this
parliament, the chancellor informed the peers and the commons that the
King's purpose in calling them together as the Great Council of the
nation was threefold:&mdash;First, he was desirous of supporting the
throne,&mdash;"his high and royal estate;" secondly, he was bent on
maintaining the law and good government within his realm; and thirdly,
he desired to cherish the friends and to resist the enemies of his
kingdom. It is remarkable that no mention is made in this parliament
at all on the part of the King, or his chancellor, of either heresy or
Lollardism. The speaker refers to some tumults, especially at
Cirencester, where the populace appear to have attacked the abbey;
complaints also were made against the conduct of ordinaries, and some
strong enactments were passed against
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page007" name="page007">(p. 007)</a></span>
the usurpations of
Rome, to which reference will again be made: but not a word in answer
to these complaints would lead to the inference that the spirit of
persecution was then in the ascendant. It was not till the last day of
April 1414, after the affair of St. Giles' Field, that the statute
against the Lollards was passed at
Leicester.<a id="notetag008" name="notetag008"></a><a href="#note008">[8]</a>
The chancellor at
that subsequent period speaks of their treasonable designs to destroy
the King having been lately discovered and discomfited; and the record
expressly declares that the ordinance was made with the consent and at
the prayer of the commons.</p>

<p>But though neither the King nor his council gave any indication, in
his first parliament, of a desire to interfere with men's consciences
in matters of religion, the churchmen were by no means slumbering at
their post. Arundel, Archbishop of Canterbury, convened a council of
the bishops and clergy, who met by adjournment, in full numbers, at
St. Paul's, on the 26th of June
1413;<a id="notetag009" name="notetag009"></a><a href="#note009">[9]</a>
and adopted most rigorous
measures for the extirpation of heresy, levelled professedly with a
more especial aim
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page008" name="page008">(p. 008)</a></span>
against the ringleader of Lollardism, as
he was called, the valiant and unfortunate Lord Cobham. On these
proceedings we purpose to dwell separately in another part of this
work; and, in addition to what we shall there allege, little needs be
observed here by way of anticipation. In leaving the subject, however,
as far as Henry V.'s character is concerned, it may not be out of
place to remark, that historical facts, so far from stamping on him
the mark of a religious persecutor, prove that it required all the
united efforts of the clergy and laity to induce him to put the
existing laws in force against those who were bold enough to dissent
from the Romish faith. So far from his "having watched the Lollards as
his greatest enemies," so far from "having listened to every calumny
which the zeal and hatred of the hierarchy could invent or propagate
against the unfortunate followers of Wickliff," (the conduct and
disposition ascribed to him by Milner,) we have sufficient proof of
the dissatisfaction of the church with him in this respect; and their
repeated attempts to excite him to more vigorous measures against the
rising and spreading sect. By a minute of council, May 27, 1415, we
find that, whilst preparing for his expedition to France, he is
reminded to instruct the archbishops and bishops to take measures,
each within his respective diocese, to resist the malice of the
Lollards. The King merely answered, that he had given the subject in
charge to his chancellor; and we are assured that Dr. Thomas
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page009" name="page009">(p. 009)</a></span>
Walden,<a id="notetag010" name="notetag010"></a><a href="#note010">[10]</a>
one of the most learned and powerful divines of the day,
but very violent in his opposition to the new doctrines, openly
inveighed against Henry <i>for his great negligence in regard to the
duty of punishing
heretics</i>.<a id="notetag011" name="notetag011"></a><a href="#note011">[11]</a>
To his religious sentiments we must
again refer in the sequel, and also as the course of events may
successively suggest any observations on that head.</p>

<p>When Henry IV. ascended the throne, parliament prayed that the Prince
might not leave the realm, but remain in England as the anchor of the
people's hopes; and, soon after his own
accession,<a id="notetag012" name="notetag012"></a><a href="#note012">[12]</a>
Henry V. is
advised by his council to remain near London, that he might receive
prompt intelligence of whatever might arise in any quarter, and be
able to take immediate steps for the safety of the commonweal. He
seems to have carried with him even from his earliest youth, wherever
he went, a peculiar talent of exciting confidence in every one.
Whether in the field of battle, or the chamber of council,&mdash;whether as
the young Prince, just initiated in affairs of war and government, or
as the experienced captain and statesman,&mdash;his contemporaries looked
to him as a kind of guardian spirit, to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page010" name="page010">(p. 010)</a></span>
protect them from
harm, and lead them onward to good success. No despondency, nor even
misgivings, show themselves in the agents of any enterprise in which
he was personally engaged. The prodigious effects of these feelings in
the English towards their prince were displayed in their full
strength, perhaps, at the battle of Agincourt; but similar results are
equally, though not so strikingly, visible in many other passages of
his life.</p>

<p>Among the various causes to which historians have been accustomed to
attribute the general anticipations of good from Henry's reign, which
pervaded all classes, is the appointment of Gascoyne to the high
station of Chief Justice immediately upon his ascending the throne.
But we have already seen that, however gladly an eulogist would seize
on such an exalted instance of magnanimity and noble generosity, the
truth of history forbids our even admitting its probability in this
place. Henry certainly did not re-appoint Gascoyne. But, whilst we
cannot admit the tradition which would mark the true character of
Henry's mind by his behaviour to the Chief Justice, there is not
wanting many an authentic record which would amply account for his
almost unprecedented popularity at the very commencement of his reign.
Among these we must not omit to notice the resolution which he put in
practice of retiring for an hour or more every day, after his early
dinner, to receive petitions
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page011" name="page011">(p. 011)</a></span>
from any of his subjects,
however
humble,<a id="notetag013" name="notetag013"></a><a href="#note013">[13]</a>
who would appeal to him for his royal
interposition; to examine and consider the several cases patiently;
and to redress real grievances. Indeed, numberless little occurrences
meet us on every side, which seem to indicate very clearly that he
loved the right and hated iniquity; and that he was never more happy
than whilst engaged in deeds of justice, mercy, and charity. He seems
to have received the golden law for his rule, "See that they who are
in need and necessity have right;" and to have rejoiced in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page012" name="page012">(p. 012)</a></span>
keeping that law himself, and compelling all within the sphere of his
authority and influence to observe it also.</p>

<p>Another incident recorded of Henry of Monmouth at this period,
strongly marking the kindness and generosity and nobleness of his
mind, was the removal of the remains of Richard II. from Langley to
Westminster. Without implying any consciousness, or even suspicion of
guilt, on the part of his father as to Richard's death, we may easily
suppose Henry to have regarded the deposition of that monarch as an
act of violence, justifiable only on the ground of extreme necessity:
he might have considered him as an injured man, by whose fall his
father and himself had been raised to the throne. Instead of allowing
his name and his mortal remains to be buried in oblivion, (with the
chance moreover of raising again in men's minds fresh doubts and
surmises of his own title to the throne, for he was not Richard's
right heir,) Henry resolved to pay all the respect in his power to the
memory of the friend of his youth, and by the only means at his
command to make a sort of reparation for the indignities to which the
royal corpse had been exposed. He caused the body to be brought in
solemn funeral state to Westminster, and there to be
buried,<a id="notetag014" name="notetag014"></a><a href="#note014">[14]</a> with
all the honour and circumstance accustomed to be paid to the earthly
remains of royalty,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page013" name="page013">(p. 013)</a></span>
by the side of his former Queen, Anne,
in the tomb prepared by Richard for her and for himself. The diligent
investigator will discover many such incidents recorded of Henry V;
some of a more public and important nature than others, but all
combining to stamp on his name in broad and indelible letters the
character of a truly high-minded, generous, grateful, warm-hearted
man.</p>

<p>Another instance of the same feeling, carried, perhaps, in one point a
step further in generosity and Christian principle, was evinced in his
conduct towards the son of Sir Henry Percy, Hotspur, the former
antagonist of his house. This young nobleman had been carried by his
friends into Scotland, for safe keeping, on the breaking out of his
grandfather's (Northumberland's) rebellion; and was detained there, as
some say, in concealment, till Henry V. made known his determination
to restore him to his title and estates. The Scots, who were in
possession of his person, kept him as a prisoner and hostage; and
although Henry might have considered a foreign land the best home for
the son of the enemy of his family, yet so bent was he on effecting
the noble design of reinstating him in all which his father's and his
grandfather's treason had forfeited, that he consented to exchange for
him a noble Scot, who had been detained in England for thirteen years.
Mordak of Fife, son and heir of the Duke of Albany, had been taken
prisoner at the battle of Homildon Hill, in 1402, (it is curious to
remark,) by Hotspur,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page014" name="page014">(p. 014)</a></span>
and his father Northumberland; and now
Henry V. exchanges this personage for Hotspur's son, the heir of
Northumberland. This youth was only an infant when his father fell at
the battle of Shrewsbury; his mother was Elizabeth, eldest daughter of
Edmund
Mortimer,<a id="notetag015" name="notetag015"></a><a href="#note015">[15]</a>
Earl of March: and thus a king, under the
circumstances of Henry, but with a less noble mind, might have
regarded him with jealousy on both sides of his parentage, and been
glad (without exposing himself to the charge of any positive act of
harshness) to allow him to remain in a foreign country deprived of his
honours and his estates. But Henry's spirit soared above these
considerations; and, in the orphan of a generous rival, he saw only a
fit object on whom to exercise his generosity and Christian charity. A
negotiation was carried on between Henry and some who represented
young Percy; care being taken to ascertain the identity of the person
who should be offered in exchange for Mordak. After certain prescribed
oaths were taken, and pledges given, and the payment of a stipulated
sum, 10,000<i>l.</i>, the young man was invited to come to Henry's court
with all speed.</p>

<p>There seems to have intervened some considerable impediment to this
proposed
exchange.<a id="notetag016" name="notetag016"></a><a href="#note016">[16]</a>
The commission to John Hull and William
Chancellor to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page015" name="page015">(p. 015)</a></span>
convey Mordak to the north bears date 21st of
May; and yet instructions for a negotiation with his father, the Duke
of Albany, then Regent of Scotland, for the exchange, were issued to
Sir Ralph Evre and others, as late as the 10th of the following
December. At the parliament, however, held March 16, 1416, Henry
Percy, in the presence of the King himself, does homage for his lands
and honours. And, before Henry's death, the Pell Rolls record payments
to this Earl of Northumberland, appointed guardian of Berwick and the
East March, as regularly as, in the early part of Henry IV.'s reign,
issues had been made to his father Hotspur, and his grandfather, the
aged Earl, for the execution of the same duties. The lands of the
Percies, on their attainder, were confiscated, and given to the King's
brother, the Duke of Bedford; to whom, on restoring his lands and
honours to the young Earl, Henry made an annual compensation in part
at least for the
loss.<a id="notetag017" name="notetag017"></a><a href="#note017">[17]</a></p>

<p>Another example of generous behaviour in the young King towards those
whom he had in his power, and of whom less noble minds would have
entertained suspicion and jealousy, is seen in his conduct towards the
Earl of
March.<a id="notetag018" name="notetag018"></a><a href="#note018">[18]</a>
This young nobleman,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page016" name="page016">(p. 016)</a></span>
by the law of
primogeniture, was rightful heir to the throne; being descended from
Lionel Duke of Clarence, third son of Edward III. And so much was he a
cause of apprehension and uneasiness to Henry IV. and his council,
that it was thought necessary to keep him in close custody, and also
near the person of the King, whenever the court removed towards the
borders of the kingdom. It was in the name of this young man that his
uncle Edmund Mortimer excited all his tenantry and dependents to join
Owyn Glyndowr in rebellion against Henry IV; and on all occasions the
malcontents of the whole country, supposing Richard to be dead, held
forth the Earl of March as their liege sovereign. Henry V. could not
have been charged with unwarrantable suspicions or severity, had he
continued the same system of watchfulness over this formidable
personage, which had been observed under the reign of his predecessor.
Provided only that he treated him with kindness, few would have
wondered or complained if he had still kept him as a prisoner on
parole.<a id="notetag019" name="notetag019"></a><a href="#note019">[19]</a>
But Henry, to whose guardianship,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page017" name="page017">(p. 017)</a></span>
whilst Prince
of Wales, the young Earl had been intrusted, was no sooner seated on
the throne, than he admitted this young man into a full share of his
confidence; not with the suspicion of a rival, nor with the fear of an
enemy, but with the openness of an acknowledged and kind master
towards a trustworthy and devoted servant.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page018" name="page018">(p. 018)</a></span>
The references to
him which are found in the authentic records of that time (and they
are not a few) all tend to establish this
point.<a id="notetag020" name="notetag020"></a><a href="#note020">[20]</a>
Henry immediately
gave him, on his coming of age, full and free possession of all his
manors, castles, lands, advowsons, and honours; and seems to have had
him continually in his retinue as a companion and friend. On one
occasion we may suppose that Henry's suspicions and apprehensions of
danger from the young Earl must have been roused; and yet we find him
still continued in his confidence, and still left without any
restraint or estrangement. When the conspiracy against Henry was
discovered at Southampton, the Earl of Cambridge, (as we shall see
more in detail hereafter,) in his letter of confession, declares it to
have been the intention of the conspirators to carry the Earl of March
into Wales, and to proclaim him as their lawful king. How far the
young Earl was privy to this conspiracy, or to what extent he was "art
and part" in it, does not distinctly appear. An expression, indeed, in
the early part of the Earl of Cambridge's letter, "Having the Earl of
March by his own consent, and by the assent of myself," should seem to
imply that he was by no means ignorant of the plans of the
conspirators, nor averse to them. How far, moreover, Henry thought him
guilty, is matter of doubt;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page019" name="page019">(p. 019)</a></span>
but certain it is, that he deemed
it necessary to have the King's pardon regularly signed in the usual
manner for all treasons, felonies, and misdemeanors. The instrument
bears date August 7, 1415, at Southampton. This document, however, by
no means proves his guilt: on many occasions such patents of pardon
were granted to prevent malicious and vexatious prosecutions.
Nevertheless, at all events, it shows that Henry's thoughts must have
been especially drawn to the relative circumstances under which
himself and the Earl of March were placed; and yet he continued to
behave towards him with the same confidence and friendship as before.
Two years afterwards, Henry appointed him his lieutenant at sea, with
full powers; yet so as not to supersede the privileges and authority
of the high admiral, the Duke of
Exeter.<a id="notetag021" name="notetag021"></a><a href="#note021">[21]</a>
The following year, in
the summer, he was made lieutenant and guardian-general of all
Normandy; and in the December of the same year he was commissioned to
receive the homage and oaths of all in that country who owed suit and
service to the King. He fought side by side with Henry at the field of
Agincourt; and there seems to have grown stronger and riper between
them a spirit of friendship and mutual
confidence.<a id="notetag022" name="notetag022"></a><a href="#note022">[22]</a></p>

<p>These <span class="pagenum"><a id="page020" name="page020">(p. 020)</a></span>
are a few among the many examples upon record of the
generous and noble spirit of Henry; whilst history may be challenged
to bring forward any instances of cruelty or oppression to neutralize
them. Sir Matthew Hale confessed that he could never discover any act
of public injustice and tyranny during the Lancastrian sway; and the
inquirer into Henry of Monmouth's character may be emboldened to
declare, that he can discover no act of wanton severity, or cruelty,
or unkindness in his life. The case of the prisoners in the day and on
the field of Agincourt, the fate of Lord Cobham, and the wars in
France, require each a separate examination; and in our inquiry we
must not forget the kind, and gentle, and compassionate spirit which
appears to breathe so naturally and uniformly from his heart: on the
other hand, we must not suffer ourselves to be betrayed into such a
full reliance on his character for mercy, as would lead us to give a
blind implicit sanction to all his deeds of arms. In our estimate of
his character, moreover, as indicated by his conduct previously to his
first invasion of France, and during his struggles and conquests
there, it is quite as necessary for us to bear in mind the tone, and
temper, and standard of political and moral government which prevailed
in his age, as it is essential for us, when we would estimate his
religious character, to recollect what were in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page021" name="page021">(p. 021)</a></span>
that age
throughout Christendom the acknowledged principles of the church in
communion with the see of Rome.</p>

<p>On Monday, April 30, 1414, Henry met his parliament at
Leicester.<a id="notetag023" name="notetag023"></a><a href="#note023">[23]</a>
Why it was not held at Westminster, we have no positive reasons
assigned in
history;<a id="notetag024" name="notetag024"></a><a href="#note024">[24]</a>
and the suggestion of some, that the
enactments there made against the Lollards were too hateful to be
passed at the metropolis, is scarcely
reasonable.<a id="notetag025" name="notetag025"></a><a href="#note025">[25]</a>
The Bishop of
Winchester, as Chancellor, set forth in very strong language the
treasonable practices lately discovered and discomfited; and the
parliament enacted a very severe law against all disturbers of the
peace of the realm and of the unity of the church. It is generally
said that the reading of the Bible in English was forbidden in this
session under very severe penalties; but no such
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page022" name="page022">(p. 022)</a></span>
enactment
seems to have been recorded. The prelates, however, were the judges of
what heresy was; and to study the Holy Scriptures in the vernacular
language might well have seemed to them a very dangerous practice; to
be checked, therefore, with a strong hand. The judges, and other state
officers, were directed to take an oath to exert themselves for the
suppression of Lollardism.</p>

<p>Again and again are we reminded, through the few years of Henry's
reign, that the cause of liberty was progressive; and any
encroachments of the royal prerogative upon the liberties of the
Commons were restrained and corrected, with the free consent and full
approbation of the King. A petition in English, presented to him in
this parliament, in many respects a curious document, with the King's
answer, bears testimony to the same point. "Our sovereign lord,&mdash;your
humble and true lieges that been come for the commons of your land,
beseech unto your right righteousness, that so as it hath ever been
their liberty and freedom that there should be no statute nor law made
otherwise than they gave their assent thereto, considering that the
commons of your land (the which is and ever hath been a member of your
parliament) been as well assenters as petitioners, that from this time
forward, by complaint of the commons of any mischief asking remedy by
mouth of their Speaker, or else by petition written, that there never
be no law made thereupon, and engrossed as statute
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page023" name="page023">(p. 023)</a></span>
and law,
neither by addition, neither by diminution, by no manner of term or
terms, the which should change the sentence and the intent asked by
the Speaker's mouth, or the petitions before said, given up in writing
without assent of the aforesaid commons." To this petition the
following answer was made: "The King, of his grace especial, granteth,
that from henceforth nothing be enacted to the petitions of his
commons that be contrary to their asking, whereby they should be bound
without their assent; saving alway to our liege lord his real
prerogative to grant or deny what him lust of their petitions and
askings aforesaid."</p>

<p>This parliament was adjourned from Leicester, and re-assembled at
Westminster on the Octaves of St. Martin, 18th November 1414. The most
gratifying record of this great council of the realm is that which
informs us of the restoration of Henry Percy to his estates and
honours. The most important subject to which the thoughts of the peers
and commons were drawn was the King's determination to recover his
rights in the realm of France.</p>

<p>The motives which influenced Henry to undertake this extraordinary
step can be known only to the Searcher of hearts. Some writers, in
their excessive zeal for Protestantism, anxiously bent on stamping
upon Henry the character of an ambitious tyrant and a religious
persecutor, employ no measured language
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page024" name="page024">(p. 024)</a></span>
in their
condemnation of his designs against France. Milner thus gives his
summary of the proceedings of this reign at home and abroad. "Henry
Chicheley, now Archbishop of Canterbury, continued at the head of that
see from February 1414, to April 1443. This man deserves to be called
the firebrand of the age in which he lived. To subserve the purposes
of his own pride and tyranny, he engaged King Henry in his famous
contest with France, by which a prodigious carnage was made of the
human race, and the most dreadful miseries were brought upon both
kingdoms. But Henry was a soldier, and understood the art of war,
though perfectly ignorant of religion; and that ardour of spirit,
which in
youth<a id="notetag026" name="notetag026"></a><a href="#note026">[26]</a>
had spent itself in vicious indulgences, was now
employed under the management of Chicheley in desolating France by one
of the most unjust wars ever waged by ambition, and in furnishing for
vulgar minds matter of declamation on the valour of the English
nation. While this scene was carrying on in France, the Archbishop at
home, partly by exile, partly by forced abjurations, and partly by the
flames, domineered over the Lollards, and almost effaced the vestiges
of godliness in the kingdom."</p>

<p>These are very hard words, much more readily written than justified.
Such sentences of condemnation require
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page025" name="page025">(p. 025)</a></span>
a much clearer
insight into the workings of the human heart than falls to the lot of
any human being to possess, when he would examine into the motives of
a fellow-mortal. It is very easy by one sweeping clause to denounce
the war as unjust, and to ascribe it to the ambition of Henry,
reckless of human suffering. But truth requires us to weigh the whole
matter far more patiently, and to substitute evidence in the place of
assumptions, and argument instead of declamation. And it is impossible
for the biographer of Henry V. to carry his reader with him through
the scenes of his preparation for the struggle with France, and his
conduct in the several campaigns which chiefly engaged from this time
till his death all the energies of his mind and body, without
recalling somewhat in detail the circumstances of Henry's position at
this time. This, however, will require also a brief review of the
state of France through some previous years of her internal discords
and misery. Reserving them for another chapter, there are some
circumstances of a more private and domestic character which it might
be well for us first to mention in this place.</p>

<p>That Henry was habitually under the influence of strong religious
feelings, though his views of Christian doctrine partook much of the
general superstition of the age, is evident; and one of the first acts
of his government was to satisfy his own conscience, and to give full
testimony to the church of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page026" name="page026">(p. 026)</a></span>
his piety, and zeal, and
devotedness, by founding three religious houses. When, exactly a
century later, Richard Fox, Bishop of Winchester, communicated to his
friend, Hugh Oldham, Bishop of Exeter, his intention of founding a
monastery, his friend, instead of giving him encouragement to proceed
with his plan, remonstrated with him on the folly of building houses,
and providing a maintenance for monks, who would live in idleness,
unprofitable to themselves and to
society;<a id="notetag027" name="notetag027"></a><a href="#note027">[27]</a>
urging him at the same
time rather to found a college for the encouragement of sound
learning: and the College of Corpus Christi in Oxford owes its
existence, humanly speaking, to that sound admonition. Perhaps, had
Henry V. been fortunate enough to meet with so able and honest an
adviser, Oxford might have had within its walls now another nursery of
religion and learning,&mdash;a monument of his piety and of his love for
whatever was commendable and of good report. Our Oxford chronicles
record his expressed intention both to reform the statutes of the
University, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page027" name="page027">(p. 027)</a></span>
also to found an establishment within the
castle walls, annexing to it all the alien priories in England for its
endowment, in which efficient provision should be made for the
instruction of youth in all the best literature of the
age.<a id="notetag028" name="notetag028"></a><a href="#note028">[28]</a>
Had he
first resolved to found his college, and reserved his religious houses
for later years, his work might still have been flourishing at this
day, and might have yet continued to flourish till the hand of
spoliation and refined barbarism shall be strong and bold enough
(should ever such a calamity visit our native land) to wrest these
seminaries of Christian principles and sound learning from the friends
of religion, and order, and peace. As it is, Henry's establishments
survived him little more than a century; and the lands which he had
destined to support them passed away into other hands, and were
alienated from religious purposes altogether.</p>

<p>The sites which Henry selected for his establishments were,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page028" name="page028">(p. 028)</a></span>
one at Shene, in Surrey; the other at Sion, in the manor of Isleworth,
on the Thames.</p>

<p>The terms of the foundation-charters of these religious houses, their
rules, and circumstances, and possessions, it does not fall within the
plan of this work to specify in detail. The brothers and sisters
admitted into these asylums appear to have been bound by very strict
rules of self-denial and poverty.</p>

<p>The monastery at Shene, built on the site of Richard II.'s palace,
which he never would enter after the loss of his wife Anne, who died
there, and which on that account he utterly destroyed, was called "The
House of Jesus of Bethlehem," and was dedicated "to the honour, and
glory, and exaltation of the name of Jesus most dear;" Henry
expressing in the foundation-charter, among sentiments less worthy of
an enlightened Christian, and savouring of the superstition of those
days, that he founded the institution in pious gratitude for the
blessings of time and of eternity, which flow only from <span class="smcap">Him</span>.</p>

<p>The house of Sion in Isleworth, or Mount Sion, as it is called in the
Pope's bull of confirmation, was dedicated "to the honour, praise, and
glory of the Trinity most High, of the Virgin Mary, of the Disciples
and Apostles of God, of all Saints, and especially of the most holy
Bridget." This house was suppressed by Henry VIII; when the nuns fled
from their native country, and took refuge, first in Zealand, then at
Mechlin, whence they removed to Rouen;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page029" name="page029">(p. 029)</a></span>
at last, fifteen
reached Lisbon in 1594. The history of this little company of sisters
is very remarkable and interesting. In Lisbon they were well received,
and were afterwards supported by royal bounty, as well as by the
benevolence of individuals. They seem to have settled there peaceably,
and to have lived in their own house, and to have had their own
church, for more than fifty years. In 1651 their house and church were
both burnt to the ground; but, through the beneficence of the pious,
they had the happiness of seeing them restored. In 1755 this little
community suffered in common with the other unfortunate inhabitants of
Lisbon, and seem to have lost their all in the earthquake. In their
distress they cast their eyes to the land of their fathers, and
applied for the charity of their countrymen. There is something very
affecting in the language of the petition by which our countrywomen in
their calamity sought to excite the sympathy, and obtain the
benevolent aid, of their fellow-Christians at home.</p>

succession by novices from England, remained in the land of their
refuge; till, in 1810, nine of them, the majority, it is said, of the
survivors, fled from the horrors of war to their native island; and
their convent, whose founder was Henry, the greatest general of his
age, became the barracks of English soldiers under Wellington, the
greatest general of the present day. On their first return they lived
in a small house in Walworth; and in 1825, the remainder, now advanced
in years and reduced to two or three in number, were still living in
the vicinity of the Potteries in Staffordshire,&mdash;the last remnant of
an English convent dissolved in the time of Henry VIII. There are at
this time mulberry-trees growing at Sion House, one of the Duke of
Northumberland's<a id="notetag029" name="notetag029"></a><a href="#note029">[29]</a>
mansions, which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page031" name="page031">(p. 031)</a></span>
are believed, not only
to have been living, but to have borne fruit, in the time of the
monastery.<a id="notetag030" name="notetag030"></a><a href="#note030">[30]</a></p>

<p>Henry seems to have had much at heart the intellectual, moral, and
religious improvement of those who might be admitted to a share of his
bounty in these establishments. The Pell Rolls record a payment "of
100<i>l.</i> part only of a larger sum, to the prior and convent of Mount
Grace, for books and other things to be supplied by them to his new
foundation at
Sion."<a id="notetag031" name="notetag031"></a><a href="#note031">[31]</a>
Whether the prior and brethren of Mount Grace
had duplicates, or were mere agents, or parted with their own stock to
meet the wishes of their King, the record does not tell.</p>

1414-1417.</h3>


<p>Some writers, (taking a very narrow and prejudiced view of the affairs
of the age to which our thoughts are directed in these Memoirs, and of
the agents employed in those transactions,) when they tell us, that
Henry was so devotedly attached to the church, and so zealous a friend
of her ministers, that he was called the Prince of Priests, would have
us believe that he "entirely resigned his understanding to the
guidance of the clergy." But his principles and his conduct
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page033" name="page033">(p. 033)</a></span>
in ecclesiastical matters have been misunderstood, and very unfairly
exaggerated and distorted. That Henry was a sincere believer in the
religion of the Cross is unquestionable; and that, in common with the
large body of believers through Christendom, he had been bred up in
the baneful error of identifying the Catholic church of Christ with
the see of Rome, is in some points of view equally evident: but that
he was a supporter of the Pope against the rights of the church in
England and other his dominions, or was an upholder of the abuses
which had then overspread the whole garden of Christ's heritage, so
far from being established by evidence, is inconsistent with the
testimony of facts. The usurpations of the Romish see called for
resistance,<a id="notetag032" name="notetag032"></a><a href="#note032">[32]</a>
and Henry to a certain extent resisted them. The
abuses in the church needed reformation, and Henry showed that he
possessed the spirit of a real reformer, bent on the correction of
what was wrong, but uncompromising in his maintenance of the religion
which he embraced in his heart. He gave proof of a spirit more
Catholic than Roman, more Apostolic than Papal.</p>

<p>In his very first parliament strong enactments were passed forbidding
ecclesiastics to receive bishoprics and benefices from Rome, on pain
of forfeiture and exile. And on complaints being made against
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page034" name="page034">(p. 034)</a></span>
the ordinaries, Henry's answer is very characteristic of his
principles of church reform: "I will direct the bishops to remedy
these evils themselves; and, if they fail, then I will myself take the
matter into my own hands."</p>

<p>He had been little more than half a year on the
throne,<a id="notetag033" name="notetag033"></a><a href="#note033">[33]</a>
when he
sent a peremptory mandate to the bishops of Aquitain, that they should
on no account obey any provision from the court of Rome, by which
preferment would be given to an enemy of England. And in the following
month, Dec. 11, 1413, Henry issued a prohibition, forbidding John
Bremore, clerk, whom the Pope had recommended to him when Prince of
Wales, to return to the court of Rome for the purpose of carrying on
mischievous designs against the King and his people, under a penalty
of 100<i>l.</i> And among his own bishops, countenanced and confidentially
employed by himself, were found men who protested honestly and
decidedly against the tyranny and corruption of Rome, and were as
zealously bent on restoring the church to the purity of its better
days, as were those martyrs to the truth who in the middle of the next
century sealed their testimony by their blood. To what extent Henry V.
must be regarded as having given a fair promise that, had he lived, he
would have devoted the energies of his mind to work out such an
effective reformation as would have satisfied the majority of the
people in England, and left little in that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page035" name="page035">(p. 035)</a></span>
way for his
successors to do, every one must determine for himself. In forming our
judgment, however, we must take into account, not only what he
actually did, but also whatever the tone, and temper, and turn of his
mind (from such intimations as we may be enabled to glean scattered up
and down through his life) might seem to have justified persons in
anticipating. It would be vain to build any theory on what might have
happened had the course of Providence in Henry's destinies been
different: and yet we may without presumption express a belief that,
had his life been spared, and had he found himself seated in peace and
security on the united throne of England and France, instead of
exhausting his resources, his powers of body and mind, and his time,
in a fruitless crusade to the Holy Land, (by which he certainly once
purposed to vindicate the honour of his Redeemer's name,) he might
have concentrated all his vast energies on the internal reformation of
the church itself. Instead of leaving her then large possessions for
the hand of the future spoiler, he might have effectually provided for
their full employment in the religious education of the whole people,
and in the maintenance of a well-educated, pious, and zealous body of
clergy, restored to their pastoral duties and devoted to the ministry.
That the church needed a vigorous and thorough, but honest and
friendly reform,&mdash;not the confiscation of her property to personal
aggrandizement and secular purposes, but the re-adjustment of what
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page036" name="page036">(p. 036)</a></span>
had degenerated from its original intention,&mdash;is proved by
evidence most painfully conclusive. Indeed, the enormities which had
grown up, and which were defended and cherished by the agents of Rome,
far exceed both in number and magnitude the present general opinion
with regard to those times. The Conventual
system<a id="notetag034" name="notetag034"></a><a href="#note034">[34]</a>
had well nigh
destroyed the efficiency of parochial ministrations: what was intended
for the support of the pastor, was withdrawn to uphold the dignity and
luxury of the monastery; parsonage houses were left to fall to decay,
and hirelings of a very inferior class were employed on a miserable
pittance to discharge their perfunctory duties as they might.
"Provisions" from Rome had exempted so large a proportion of the
spirituality from episcopal jurisdiction, that, even had all the
bishops been appointed on the principle of professional excellence,
their power of restoring discipline would have been lamentably
deficient. But in their appointment was evinced the most reckless
prostitution of their sacred order. Not only was the selection of
bishops made without reference to personal merit and individual
fitness, whilst regard was had chiefly to high connexions and the
interests of the Papacy;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page037" name="page037">(p. 037)</a></span>
but even children were made
bishops, and the richest dignities of the church were heaped upon
them: foreigners unacquainted with the language of the people were
thrust into offices, for the due discharge of the duties of which a
knowledge of the vernacular language was absolutely necessary. The
courts ecclesiastical ground down the clergy by shameless extortions;
whilst appeals to Rome put a complete bar against any suit for
justice. Their luxury and excesses, their pride and overbearing
presumption, their devotedness to secular pursuits, the rapacious
aggrandizement of themselves and their connexions, and the total
abandonment of their spiritual duties in the cure of souls, coupled
with an ignorance almost incredible, had brought the large body of the
clergy into great disrepute, and had filled sincere Christians
(whether lay or clerical, for there were many exceptions among the
clergy themselves) with an ardent longing for a thorough and efficient
reformation. It is true that their indignation was chiefly roused by
the prostitution of the property of the church, and its alienation
from the holy purposes for which the church was endowed; and that
gross neglect of discipline rather than errors in doctrine called into
life the spirit of reformation: but even in points of faith we
perceive in many clear signs of a genuine love of Evangelical and
Catholic truth; among whom we are not without evidence sufficient to
justify us in numbering the subject of these Memoirs. Henry of
Monmouth, whilst
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page038" name="page038">(p. 038)</a></span>
he adhered constantly to the faith of his
fathers, yet manifested a sincere desire to become more perfectly
acquainted with the truth of the Gospel; and spared no pains, even
during his career of war and victory, in providing himself with the
assistance of those teachers who had the reputation of preaching the
Gospel most sincerely and efficiently. Henry's, indeed, was not the
religion which would substitute in the scale of Christian duties
punctuality of attendance on frequent preaching for the higher and
nobler exercises of adoration. Many an unobtrusive incident intimates
that his soul took chief delight in communing with God by acts of
confession, and prayer, and praise. He seems to have imbibed the same
spirit which in a brother-monarch once gave utterance to expressions
no less valuable in the matter of sound theology, than exquisitely
beautiful in their
conception:<a id="notetag035" name="notetag035"></a><a href="#note035">[35]</a>
"I had rather pass an hour in
conversation with my friend than hear twenty discourses in his
praise." And yet Henry delighted also in hearing Heaven's message of
reconciliation faithfully expounded, and enforced home.</p>

<p>Whilst, for example, he was pursuing his conquests in Normandy, the
report no sooner reached him of a preacher named Vincentius, (who was
labouring zealously in the cause of Christ in various parts of
Brittany, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page039" name="page039">(p. 039)</a></span>
who was said by his earnest and affectionate
preaching to have converted many to the Lord their God,) than Henry
sent for him, and took great delight in hearing his faithful
expositions of the word of truth and life. And we have good reason for
believing that the consolations of the pure doctrines of the Gospel,
as a guardian angel ministering the cup of Heaven, attended him
through life and in death.</p>

<p>There is no intimation dropped by historians, nor is it intended in
these Memoirs to intimate, that Henry's eyes were opened to the
doctrinal errors of the church of Rome. But there are circumstances
well worthy of consideration before we pronounce definitively on that
point. When we bear in mind that, in those days, prayers and vows were
habitually made to the Virgin for success, and, after any prosperous
issue of the supplicants' exertions in war or peace, offerings of
thanksgiving were addressed to her as the giver of victory and of
every blessing; and whilst, at the same time, we find in Henry of
Monmouth's letters and words no acknowledgment of any help but God's
only; the question may be fairly entertained, whether he had not
imbibed some portion of the pure light of Gospel truth on this very
important article of Christian faith. The Author is well aware of the
words at the close of his Will, referred to hereafter; and is very far
from saying that he should be surprised to find other instances of a
similar character. Still Henry's silence as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page040" name="page040">(p. 040)</a></span>
to the power and
assistance of the Virgin, the absence of prayer to her in his
devotions, many of which are especially recorded; the absence of
praise to her after victory and success, though he was very far from
taking praise to himself, always ascribing it to God Almighty only,
may seem to justify the suggestion of an inquiry into this point.</p>

<p>For a knowledge of the degraded state to which the church had sunk,
and her inefficiency as the guardian and dispenser of religious truth,
we are not left to the vague representations of declaimers, or the
heated exaggerations of those by whom everything savouring of Rome is
held in abomination. The preambles of the laws which were intended to
cure the evils, bear the most direct and full evidence of their
existence and extent. One parliamentary document, after prefacing that
"Benefices were founded for the honour of God, the good of the
founders, the government and relief of the parishioners, and the
advancement of the clergy," then states "that the spiritual patrons,
the regular clergy throughout the whole realm, mischievously
appropriate to themselves the said benefices, and lamentably cast to
the ground the houses and buildings, and cruelly take away and destroy
divine service, hospitality, and other works of charity, which used to
be performed in the said benefices to the poor and distressed; that
they exclude and ever debar the clergymen from promotion, and
privately convey the treasure of the realm in great sums to the court
of Rome,&mdash;to the confusion
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page041" name="page041">(p. 041)</a></span>
of their own souls, the grievous
desolation of the
parishioners<a id="notetag036" name="notetag036"></a><a href="#note036">[36]</a>
and the whole country, the ultimate
ruin of the clergy, the great impoverishment of the realm, and the
irrecoverable ruin of the holy church of
England."<a id="notetag037" name="notetag037"></a><a
href="#note037">[37]</a></p>

<p>A case argued before the judges in the time of Henry IV, very
interesting in itself, and closely connected in many points with the
subject of this chapter, is recorded in the Year Books. The argument
arose on a writ of Quare impedit, directed against Halomm (Hallam)
Bishop of Salisbury and Chichel (Chicheley) Bishop of St. David's,
afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury. The question at issue regarded
the voidance of a prebend in the church of Salisbury, caused by
Chicheley being created Bishop of St. David's, who held that prebend,
to which he had been presented by Richard Medford, a former Bishop of
Sarum. Against the King's claim of right of presentation to the void
prebend, the defendants answered that the Pope had granted to
Chicheley licence to enjoy all the preferments which he held before,
together with his bishopric.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page042" name="page042">(p. 042)</a></span>
For the King's right it was
pleaded, that the creation of Chicheley took place whilst the
temporalities of Sarum were in the hands of the King, on the
translation of Hallam from York to
Sarum;<a id="notetag038" name="notetag038"></a><a href="#note038">[38]</a>
but the question at
length turned virtually upon the power of the see of Rome to dispense
with the laws of England.</p>

<p>In the first sitting (Mich. 11 Henry IV.&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> 1409), Horton for the
defendants alleged, "We continued in possession of the prebend after
Richard Hallam had received the temporalities from the hands of the
King. Subsequently to which, and before we were created Bishop of St.
David's, our Saint Peter the Apostle, reciting by his bulls that we
were elected Bishop of St. David's, granted us licence to enjoy all
our other benefices." On which, Thirning, Justice, observed, "The
grant of the Apostle in this case cannot change the law of the land."
To which Hankford (who proved himself throughout the most zealous
supporter of the omnipotence of the Popedom) merely replied, "The Pope
can do all things;" his use of the Latin words evidently showing that
he was quoting a dictum,&mdash;"Papa omnia potest." After some discussion,
and a reference to former precedents chiefly alleged by Hankford,
Thirning rejoins very significantly, "That was in ancient times, and I
will not raise the question as to the power of the Apostle;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page043" name="page043">(p. 043)</a></span>
but I cannot see how he by his bulls can change the law of
England."<a id="notetag039" name="notetag039"></a><a href="#note039">[39]</a>
In the third deliberation, Culpeper says, "The intention
of the statute is now to be considered; and I conceive that it was
made to protect the King and other patrons in their rights, and to
restrain the encroachment of the Apostle which he makes against the
law." On the third discussion, Till argued, "Since by the law of the
land the creation of a bishop causes a voidance in fact of a benefice
before held, and by such voidance the title of presentation or
collation accrues to the patron, I say that the Apostle can by no
grant beforehand oust the patron of his right, and restrain the title
which ought to accrue to him upon such creation: for if so, he ought
to restrain and change the course of inheritance by the law of the
land; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page044" name="page044">(p. 044)</a></span>
and that he cannot do, no more than if the King wished
to give or grant to a man that he should hold his lands after he has
entered upon a monastic life, and professed; for such grant would be
contrary to the common law of the land, and therefore would be
altogether void. So also in this case." To this argument Horton
replied, among other points, "I take it that the Apostle may grant to
a man to hold three bishoprics at a time;" in which Hankford agreed,
"provided it were with the consent of the patrons." On which Skeene
observed, "If the Pope made such a grant, the King might retain the
temporalities in his own hands, if he wished it." To this observation,
Hankford, among many other things, said, "The Apostle can in many
cases change the course of the law of the land, and prevent the
occurrence of that which ought to follow." The same judge, pressing
again the argument on which he had before relied, asks, "What say ye?
suppose the Apostle, before a man becomes a professed monk, grants him
a dispensation to hold his benefices after his profession?"&mdash;"I say,"
replied Hill, "that in such a case he cannot deprive me of my right of
patronage."</p>

<p>The question at issue was found to be so difficult of solution, and
the judges viewed the law of the case in such opposite lights, that it
was argued and debated between them by adjournment in four several
terms; at length the advocates of the Pope's omnipotence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page045" name="page045">(p. 045)</a></span>
gave way, and judgment was given for the
Crown.<a id="notetag040" name="notetag040"></a><a href="#note040">[40]</a></p>

<p>Among many memorable facts recorded by the Year Book during the
progress of this cause, most persons probably will regard with
interest the resistance made by the Crown, at this period, against the
encroachments of the Pope,&mdash;the boundless power, ecclesiastical and
political, assumed and exercised by the pontiff, and conceded to him
in England,&mdash;and, at the same time, the spirit which shows itself on
the part of some of our judges to vindicate the supremacy of the law
of England over the alleged omnipotence of the court of Rome. The
great difference of opinion also as to the power of the Pope,
expressed by the members of the judicial bench, cannot fail to
interest every Englishman, whether lawyer or not; whilst the terms in
which some of the judges speak of the encroachments of the Apostolic
see, against which the legislature of England had deemed it necessary
to enact some stringent laws, are not a little remarkable. But to
Protestants of the present day, perhaps the most surprising feature of
all may appear to be the title ascribed to the Pope by the judges,
whilst publicly and solemnly dispensing the laws of the country. They
do not speak of him as the Pope, except once in the citation of a
Latin dictum; nor do they refer to him as a sovereign pontiff
exercising the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page046" name="page046">(p. 046)</a></span>
delegated authority of the chief Apostle, and
representing him in the church militant on earth: they do not give him
the title of "successor to St. Peter," or "our father filling the
Apostolic chair:"&mdash;they speak of him throughout in direct terms as
"the Apostle;" and in some passages they even call him "Saint Peter,"
and "our Saint Peter" the
Apostle.<a id="notetag041" name="notetag041"></a><a href="#note041">[41]</a>
It is however very curious, in
tracing the argument in this cause, to lay the strong terms employed
by the advocates of the Pope's paramount authority side by side with
the striking expressions used by others of those high functionaries on
the supremacy of the English law, and the inability of the Apostolic
see in the plenitude of its power to change or dispense with the
common or statute law of the realm.</p>

<p>Abuses such as we have referred to in the previous sections of this
chapter prevailed everywhere, and called loudly for vigorous measures
to rectify them. At the same period the church through Christendom was
distracted and torn by contending factions, each supporting a pontiff
of its own.</p>

<p>To put an end to these disgraceful and unhappy feuds, as destructive
of the peace of Europe as they were hurtful to the cause of true
religion, and to effect a full reformation in the church, the Council
of Constance was professedly convened. That synod was summoned
nominally by Pope John XXIII,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page047" name="page047">(p. 047)</a></span>
but in reality by the united
voice of the sovereigns of Europe, especially at the instance of the
Emperor Sigismund himself. It falls not within the province of these
Memoirs to record the proceedings of that council, either in
extinguishing the flame of discord within the pale of the church, or
in kindling the sadder flame of
persecution<a id="notetag042" name="notetag042"></a><a href="#note042">[42]</a>
against all who dared
to think for themselves in a matter peculiarly their own, or in its
lamentable forgetfulness of the abuses for the correction of which it
was mainly convened. The records of the Council of Constance, however,
abound in matters of interest in connection with the immediate and
professed object of this work. We infer from them that Henry V. was
then taking a lead in religious matters, and, whilst he was anxious to
resist the overbearing tyranny of Rome, he was at the same time bent
on making the religious establishment within his own kingdom an
efficient means of conveying to all his subjects the blessings of the
Gospel; he was an honest reformer of abuses, but, at the same time,
the conscientious and uncompromising supporter of the religion of his
fathers.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>It was on the 20th of October 1414, that Robert Hallam, Bishop of
Salisbury, the Bishops of Bath and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page048" name="page048">(p. 048)</a></span>
Hereford, the Abbot of
Westminster, the Prior of Worcester, Lord Warwick, and others, were
commissioned by Henry to proceed to Constance, and as his
representatives<a id="notetag043" name="notetag043"></a><a href="#note043">[43]</a>
to treat about the reformation of the universal
church; or, as the Pell Rolls speak, "for the salvation of Christian
souls." Another body of commissioners was subsequently sent, when not
less than four hundred Englishmen went in company of the embassy,
among whom were reckoned two archbishops, seven bishops, and many
other lords and gentlemen. Of those who were first commissioned by
Henry, Robert Hallam (or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page049" name="page049">(p. 049)</a></span>
Allam) was most strenuous in urging
the work of reformation before and above all other matters with which
they had to do. The Cardinals were equally urgent to have the election
of Pope first settled, and then to proceed afterwards to the question
of reformation. The Bishop of Salisbury, acting, doubtless, with the
full approbation, it may be at the immediate suggestion of Henry, was
instant, in season and out of season, in forcing the work of
reformation on the Council. He was called the Emperor's right hand, so
entirely did he and Sigismund co-operate for this purpose. Indeed, the
English generally appear at first to have been among the principal
promoters of reform, and, as long as Hallam lived, to have pursued it
zealously; but on his
death<a id="notetag044" name="notetag044"></a><a href="#note044">[44]</a>
they were much less noted for the same
zeal. Previously, however, to that event, a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page050" name="page050">(p. 050)</a></span>
great schism
arose among the English at Constance, and the authority of the bishops
was much disregarded. To remedy these disorders, Henry wrote a
peremptory letter (18 July 1417), commanding all his people to be
obedient to the bishops, and to abstain from all factious conduct;
enjoining them, on pain of forfeiting their goods, either to behave in
a manner becoming his subjects, or to return home; directing also,
that, in all differences of opinion, the minority should conform to
the decision of the majority.</p>

<p>Bishop Hallam entertained a most rooted antipathy to the Pope and the
Popedom; and he once gave expression to his sentiments so freely and
unreservedly to the Pope himself, that his Holiness complained
grievously of him to the Emperor: but Sigismund was himself too
heartily bent on reforming the abuses of the Popedom to chide the zeal
and freedom of the English prelate. On one occasion the Bishop
maintained that a General Council was superior to the Pope (a doctrine
subsequently recognised, but then, as it should seem, new and bold);
on <span class="pagenum"><a id="page051" name="page051">(p. 051)</a></span>
another he is reported to have gone so far as to affirm
that the Pope, for his enormities, deserved to be burnt alive. Bishop
Hallam<a id="notetag045" name="notetag045"></a><a href="#note045">[45]</a>
was by no means singular either in the sentiments which he
entertained with regard to the corruptions of the Romish Church "<i>in
its head and its members</i>," and the imperative necessity of an
universal reform, or in the unreserved boldness and plainness with
which he published those sentiments. The whole of Christendom rang
with loud and bitter complaints against the avarice, the sensuality,
the overreaching and overbearing tyranny, the total degeneracy and
worthlessness of the Popes, the Cardinals, and the religious orders;
but in no place were the protests against
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page052" name="page052">(p. 052)</a></span>
such deplorable
corruptions more unsparingly uttered than at the Council of Constance
itself: and among those who willingly offered themselves to testify,
in their Saviour's name, against such a prostitution of his blessed
Gospel to the purposes of worldly ambition, such gross depravity and
total neglect of duty, the names of many of our own countrymen are
recorded. These pillars of the church, these lights in the midst of
darkness, seem indeed to have entertained sentiments, as to the duties
and responsibilities of the Christian priesthood, worthy of the purest
age. Some of their recorded doctrines are truly edifying, and find a
response in some of the best episcopal charges and admonitions of the
Protestant church at the present day.</p>

<p>Among these excellent men, Dr. Richard Ullerston, of Oxford, seems to
have taken a most primitive view of the duties of a Christian bishop.
He wrote a treatise in 1408, by way of memorial for Bishop Hallam, his
friend, who urged him to the work, when that uncompromising reformer
went to the Council of Pisa. At the close of a long and powerful
exhortation to provide for the due execution by the Popes of their own
ministerial duties, and for the restoration of discipline in the
church, he thus expresses himself: "Things being thus restored to
their right order, and all abuses being cut away, the Pope will employ
himself, agreeably to the duties of his charge, in procuring peace for
Christians, not only by praying, but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page053" name="page053">(p. 053)</a></span>
by preaching the Gospel
himself, and sending everywhere good preachers, who by their doctrine
and example might urge on princes and people throughout the world
their several duties, and who might make a holy war upon the passions
of mankind, rooting up those sensual desires which, according to St.
James, are the source of wars and divisions in the church and in the
state." This treatise was published in Germany about the year 1700,
from a manuscript in Trinity College, Cambridge; and may be found at
the end of Van der Hardt's work on the Council of Constance. It
consists chiefly of petitions for the remedy of abuses, and is full
from beginning to end of the true spirit of genuine evangelical
religion. Dr. Ullerston remained in uninterrupted and perfect
communion with the church of Rome; and yet no Protestant, who ever
suffered at the stake for his opposition to her, could have more
faithfully exposed the practical grievances under which Christendom
then mourned in consequence of her dereliction of duty, whilst she
assumed to herself all supreme authority, and paralyzed the efforts of
national churches to remedy the crying evils of the time. The heads of
Ullerston's petitions abound with salutary suggestions; by many of the
items we are apprised of the grievances then chiefly complained of, or
the departments in which those grievances were found.</p>

<p>1. On the election of a Pope.</p>

<p>2. On the suppression of simony.</p>

<p>3. On
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page054" name="page054">(p. 054)</a></span>
the exaltation of the law of Christ above all human
authority.</p>

<p>4. Against appropriations, <i>i. e.</i> assigning the proceeds of parochial
cures to monasteries.</p>

<p>5. On appointing only fit persons to ecclesiastical stations.</p>

<p>6. Against exemptions of monasteries and individuals from episcopal
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>7. Against dispensations,&mdash;those, among others, by which benefices and
bishoprics were given to children.</p>

<p>8. Against pluralities.</p>

<p>9. Against appeals to Rome.</p>

<p>10. Against the abuse of privileges.</p>

<p>11. Against the clergy devoting themselves to secular affairs.</p>

<p>12. Against the prerogatives of
chanters<a id="notetag046" name="notetag046"></a><a href="#note046">[46]</a>
and other officers in the
houses of the great.</p>


<p>13. Generally
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page055" name="page055">(p. 055)</a></span>
against extortions.</p>

<p>14. Against excessive expenses in the persons and the families of the
clergy.</p>

<p>15. For a provision for more efficient divine service in parishes.</p>

<p>16. For the restoration of peace through Christendom.</p>

<p>In his reflections on these points there is so much sound sense and
genuine affection for true religion, such an ardent desire pervades
them of promoting the ends for which alone an establishment can be
justified on warrant of Scripture, or is in itself desirable,&mdash;the
salvation of souls through Christ for ever,&mdash;that, had it not been out
of place, the Author would have gladly transcribed a great part of Dr.
Ullerston's sentiments into these pages. His suggestions savour
throughout of genuine piety and true practical wisdom.</p>

<p>To Ullerston must be added Walter Dysse, who was commissioned by Pope
Boniface IX. to proceed to Spain, Portugal, and Aquitain, to preach a
crusade against the infidels. He was a most deadly enemy to the
followers of Wicliffe, and a devoted friend to the court of Rome; yet
he could not pass over in silence the cause of the divisions and
corruptions of the church, nor the means of their effectual
reformation.</p>

<p>But, perhaps, among all those whom the history of this Council records
as zealous promoters of a real reformation within the church itself,
our more immediate object
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page056" name="page056">(p. 056)</a></span>
in these Memoirs would require us
to make especial mention of Thomas Walden, because he was one of Henry
of Monmouth's own
chaplains,<a id="notetag047" name="notetag047"></a><a href="#note047">[47]</a>
and was employed by him not only in
domestic concerns, but in foreign
embassies.<a id="notetag048" name="notetag048"></a><a href="#note048">[48]</a>
He was called the
Netter, from the expertness and success with which he caught and
mastered his antagonists in argument. He was present at the Council of
Pisa as well as of Constance. He proved himself throughout a most
bitter persecutor of heretics; and (as Van der Hardt expresses
himself) the less imbued he was with any affection towards the
disciples of Huss, or influenced by it, so much the more sincere a
censor was he of the ecclesiastical corruptions of his time. He was
bent on reforming the abuses of the church with a strong hand, and so
far the wishes of his royal master coincided with his own; but he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page057" name="page057">(p. 057)</a></span>
could not prevail upon the King to go hand-in-hand with him in
persecuting the heretics. Walden was bold enough, in his mistaken
zeal, to charge Henry with a culpable remissness in what was then too
generally supposed to be the duty of a Christian
sovereign.<a id="notetag049" name="notetag049"></a><a href="#note049">[49]</a></p>

<p class="p2">

<p>A communication made personally to Henry from Constance, in the
beginning of the year
1417,<a id="notetag050" name="notetag050"></a><a href="#note050">[50]</a>
deserves in this place our especial
attention. The letter, written by John
Forester,<a id="notetag051" name="notetag051"></a><a href="#note051">[51]</a>
may perhaps be
considered a fair specimen of correspondence between Englishmen of
education at that period. As a vehicle of information on the real
state of feeling in England with regard to the church of Rome, it is
very interesting. It is, moreover, impossible to read it without
inferring that, in the opinion of the writer at least, and of those in
whose behalf he wrote, Henry's earnest desire was to reform the abuses
of the church, and to render churchmen zealous servants of the Gospel.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page058" name="page058">(p. 058)</a></span></p>


<p>"My sovereign liege Lord, and most redoubted Prince Christian to
     me on earth. I recommend me unto your high royal and imperial
     Majesty with all manner [of] honours, worships, grace, and
     goodnesses. My most glorious Lord, liketh you to wit, that the
     Wednesday, the third hour after noon, or near thereto, the seven
     and twentieth day of January, your brother['s] gracious person
     the King of Rome entered the city of Constance with your livery
     of the Collar about his neck,&mdash;a glad sight for all your liege
     men to see,&mdash;with a solemn procession of all estates, both of
     Cardinals of all nations, and your Lords in their best array with
     all your nation. He received your Lords graciously, with right
     good cheer. Of all the worshipful men of your nation he touched
     their hands, [and theirs] only, in all the great press. And then
     went my Lord of Salisbury [Hallam] before heartily to the place
     of the general Council, where that royal King should rest; and he
     entered into the pulpit where the Cardinal
Candacence,<a id="notetag052" name="notetag052"></a><a href="#note052">[52]</a> chief
     of the nation of France, and your especial enemy also, had
     purposed to have made the first
collation<a id="notetag053" name="notetag053"></a><a href="#note053">[53]</a>
before the
     King,<a id="notetag054" name="notetag054"></a><a href="#note054">[54]</a>
in worship of the French nation. But my Lord of
     Salisbury kept possession, in worship of you and your nation; and
     he made there a right good collation that pleased the King right
     well: and forasmuch as the King was fasting at that hour, then
     would no man occupy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page059" name="page059">(p. 059)</a></span>
him more that day; but on the morn
     (my liege Lord) liketh you to wit, that at nine of the bell all
     your ambassadors, with all your nation in their best array, went
     to worship him in his palace, and that he gave them glad and
     gracious audience. There my Lord of Chester, the president of
     your nation, had his words to him in such a wise that it was
     worship to him and all our nation; and soon after this they took
     their leave of him. And on the morrow he sends after them again
     at ten of the clock. There he received them again every man by
     hand. Then he made a collation to our nation, and he thanked them
     especially that they had been so loving, trusty, and true to his
     nation in his absence. Also, he rehearsed there how the
     brotherhood [friendship] began between him and my Lord your
     father; and how it is now so continued and knit for you and your
     successors, with the grace of God, for ever. And he told them so
     great worship of your royal person, and such of all my Lords your
     brethren; and then of the governance of holy church, divine
     service, ornaments, and all state thereof, kept as though it were
     in Paradise, in comparison with any place that he ever came in
     before; so that from the highest unto the lowest he commended
     your glorious and gracious person, your realm, and your good
     governance. And then my Lord of Chester, our president, in the
     name of all our nation (as belongeth to his office) rehearsed
     compendiously, and in a gentle wise, all that ever the Emperor
     had said; and gave him an answer to every point so good and so
     reasonable, in so short avisement, that he has got him the thanks
     of your nation for ever. And also, sovereign liege Lord, as I may
     understand, my Lords of Salisbury and Chester are fully disposed,
     by the consent of all your other ambassadors, to suive [pursue]
     the reformation in the church, in the head and the members,
     having no regard to no
benefices<a id="notetag055" name="notetag055"></a><a href="#note055">[55]</a>
that they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page060" name="page060">(p. 060)</a></span> have,
     rather than it should be left undone. And of this I doubt me
     nought that these two lords will abide hard and nigh, always by
     the good advice and deliberation of your brother the King of
     Rome. Moreover, liketh you to wit, that on Sunday, the last day
     of January, your brother, the King of Rome, wore the gown of the
     Garters, with your collar, openly at the high mass; and he was
     lereth [learned] that the Duke of Beyer and the borough-grave
     should eat with my Lord of London the same day, and he said he
     would eat with them. Other tidings be there none, but, as it is
     said, the ambassadors of Spain should be here in Constance within
     a few days. And, on Candlemas eve, came letters from the French
     King, commanding to his nation to put out the ambassadors of the
     Duke of Burgundy from their nation; also, as it is said openly,
     that the foresaid French King hath sent to the city of Genoa, and
     forwarded a great sum of gold to
[hire<a id="notetag056" name="notetag056"></a><a href="#note056">[56]</a>]
wage great ships and
     galleys, to destroy your ordinance and your navy of England. And
     further, the day of making this letter, Master Philip Moyar
     entered Constance in good health, thanked be God! The which God,
     of his gracious goodness, keep your high, honourable, and
     gracious person in his pleasance, and send you sovereignty and
     victory of all your enemies. Written at Constance, the second day
     of February,<br>

<p>It <span class="pagenum"><a id="page061" name="page061">(p. 061)</a></span>
is curious to remark that, on the very Sunday before this
letter was written, the English bishops caused a sort of pious comedy
to be acted in the presence of the Emperor Sigismund. It was one of
those mysteries, as they were called, which had so long mingled
religious instruction (of a very questionable character) with
amusement. The fruits of these exhibitions were probably very
equivocal in that age in England, as they are on the Continent at this
day. The Germans consider this play, which was the representation of
the Nativity,<a id="notetag058" name="notetag058"></a><a href="#note058">[58]</a>
the Massacre of the Innocents, and the Visit of the
Magi, as the first introduction of that sort of dramatic performance
into their country. The English had caused a rehearsal to be performed
before the authorities of the place three or four times previously, in
order to make the actors perfect for their imperial audience.</p>

<p>About half a year after the date of this letter to Henry, his uncle,
Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester, reached Constance in the garb of
a pilgrim, on his journey to the Holy Land. His safe-conduct is dated
July 21, 1417. His arrival at Constance was very prejudicial to the
cause of the reform of the church. The struggle then was between the
imperial party
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page062" name="page062">(p. 062)</a></span>
(to which the English were closely attached)
and the Cardinals, whether the Pope should be first elected, or
whether the reformations in the church should take precedence of his
election. Henry Beaufort, to whom all parties seem to have paid the
utmost deference, suggested the expediency of first electing the Pope;
the Cardinals pledging themselves, that done, to proceed forthwith to
the reformation. His advice was followed, and the result must have
been a disappointment to all sincere Christians: a death-blow was
given to the hopes which had been entertained of a reform in
ecclesiastical affairs to be effected by that Council. No sooner was
Pope Martin V. elected, than both himself and the Cardinals frustrated
every attempt to secure a sound reformation; and, after sitting three
years and six months, the Council was dissolved.</p>

<p>The records of this Council of Constance bear incidentally most
valuable evidence to the warm interest taken by Henry in everything
over which he had any control, and in which he could beneficially
employ his power and influence. They prove, moreover, that whilst he
was a sincere promoter of a sound and wholesome reformation, and most
zealously attached to the religion in which he had been brought up,
and in which he was a conscientious believer, he was no persecutor.
Though our souls are harrowed up by the unchristian proceedings
against John Huss and Jerome of Prague, (and, could truth allow it, we
would gladly wipe away so
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page063" name="page063">(p. 063)</a></span>
black a stain from the annals of
ages and nations called Christian,) it is a source of great
satisfaction to find that the name of Henry of Monmouth is not at all
mixed up with those deeds of blood: we find him neither encouraging
nor approving them. Not one shadow of suspicion is suggested that the
persecuting spirit, which in that Council displayed itself so
outrageously and inhumanly, found any thoughts in his breast
responsive to its cruel aspirations. We know, indeed, that Thomas
Walden, his priest and chaplain, was actuated by the spirit of
persecution towards the Lollards; but we are equally assured that, so
far from being countenanced and encouraged by his master in acts of
persecuting bigotry, he did not scruple openly in public, and solemnly
in a sermon, to charge him with a want of zeal in extirpating the
enemies of the church. From such a witness the testimony so borne to
the charity and moderation of Henry of Monmouth is very valuable and
satisfactory; abundantly outweighing all the declamation of modern
enthusiastic censors. Henry was a reformer,&mdash;he could not be persuaded
to become a
persecutor.<a id="notetag059" name="notetag059"></a><a href="#note059">[59]</a></p>

<p>Henry's reputation for having at heart the correction of all abuses in
the church, encouraged the University of Oxford to present to him a
petition, setting forth a multitude of corrupt practices which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page064" name="page064">(p. 064)</a></span>
were a disgrace to the Christian religion in England; and praying
him, since God had raised him up to such an exalted place in the
church, to put forth his power in effecting a
reformation.<a id="notetag060" name="notetag060"></a><a href="#note060">[60]</a>
This
document, preserved in Corpus Christi College in Oxford, abounds in
topics of deep and lively interest; it marks the fearful extent to
which the corrupt practices in the church had been fostered by Rome,
the ardent desire entertained in England for a reformation so early as
the commencement of the fifteenth century, and Henry's anxiety to
bring about such a reform in the discipline of the church as might
safely be adopted without giving countenance and encouragement to the
Lollards, against whom the University seems at this time to have been
decidedly hostile.</p>

<p>The points to which Oxford then solicited Henry to direct his especial
care, were partly such as are no longer of general interest among us,
(excepting so far as they remind us of the mass of evils from which
the Reformation rescued us,) and partly
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page065" name="page065">(p. 065)</a></span>
such as must be
interesting to Christians of every age.</p>

<p>Among the former grievances were reckoned the Pope's unlimited
creation of cardinals, all to be supported out of the revenues of the
church; the excessive grants of indulgences, by which persons were
encouraged in licentiousness; the privileges and exemptions and
scandalous immorality of the monks. The petitioners complained
bitterly that though the church of England would not admit persons
into sacred orders who were unfit and unworthy, yet the court of Rome
would repeatedly recognise such as lawful ministers.</p>

<p>Among the latter evils were the non-residence of incumbents, the
inadequacy of the stipends of curates, and the commendams of bishops.
The petitioners prayed, that whereas a great number both of regulars
and seculars who were presumptuous and ignorant were ordained, a
decree might be passed that all before ordination should be strictly
examined; and that a remedy should be provided against
simony.<a id="notetag061" name="notetag061"></a><a href="#note061">[61]</a>
They petitioned, also, that foreigners who could not speak English
should have no cures in England; and they complained of the practice
of patrons exacting from the priests whom they nominated to a benefice
a pledge that they would
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page066" name="page066">(p. 066)</a></span>
not sue for an augmentation of
their stipend, were it never so small. They closed their petition by
praying that all bishops who were remiss in punishing heresy, and
extirpating Lollardy, might be deposed; and that all magistrates and
officers should be bound by their oath to aid in its
extirpation.<a id="notetag062" name="notetag062"></a><a href="#note062">[62]</a></p>

<p>Henry, deeply lamenting the gross abuses referred to in this petition,
implored the Pope to suffer them to be redressed. His Holiness agreed
to certain constitutions, by which, if fully acted upon, most of the
evils complained of would have been rectified. The Pope, however,
begged Henry in return to abrogate all the laws which had been enacted
in England to the prejudice of Rome; but the King declared his
inability to meet the wishes of his Holiness.</p>

<p>The extent to which the abuse of the
Pope's<a id="notetag063" name="notetag063"></a><a href="#note063">[63]</a>
authority had been
connived at in this country,&mdash;a state of things which naturally
indisposed him towards any change for the better,&mdash;may be inferred
from two facts: that he (in defiance of the statutes of Edward III.
and Richard II.) had by his own authority
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page067" name="page067">(p. 067)</a></span>
created thirteen
bishops in the province of Canterbury in two years; and had appointed
his nephew, Prospero Colonna, a boy of only fourteen years of age,
Archdeacon of Canterbury, with fourteen benefices in England.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>Before we leave this subject, we cannot but record an instance
(mentioned by Walsingham) of Henry's personal exertions in reforming
abuses. He had received complaints against the Benedictine monks of
certain grievous corruptions; and, attended only by four persons, he
went into the midst of a full assembly of that order. The meeting
consisted of sixty abbots and priors of convents, and more than three
hundred monks, who were all assembled in the Chapter-house of
Westminster. After a speech from the Bishop of Exeter, (one of those
who accompanied him,) Henry himself addressed them at great length. He
reminded them of the ancient piety of the monks, and the devotion of
his predecessors and others in founding and endowing monasteries; he
expatiated on the negligence and remissness in the discharge of their
sacred duties, which, he said, had become notorious in their times;
and he then exhibited certain articles according to which he required
them to reform themselves; earnestly entreating them to recover the
ancient spirit of religion which they had lost, and habitually to pray
for the King, the country, and the church; assuring them that, if they
followed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page068" name="page068">(p. 068)</a></span>
his directions, they needed fear none of their
enemies.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>That Henry V, though earnestly desirous of a sound reform in the
discipline of the church, and the lives and ministrations of the
clergy, did never lay the axe to the root of the evil, cannot be
denied. Perhaps he was disheartened by the total failure of the united
efforts of himself and Sigismund, with their honest and zealous
adherents, at Constance. Perhaps he resolved to wait till, at the
close of his continental campaigns, in the enjoyment of peace at home
and abroad, he might be able to devote his concentrated exertions to
an object of such paramount importance. Perhaps the ambition of his
uncle Henry Beaufort, who evidently was looking for personal
aggrandizement in wealth and dignity, and who had given so decided and
unhappy a turn in the council of Constance in favour of the Pope's
party, might have devised some means for seducing his nephew's ardent
thoughts into another channel. To whatever cause we may be disposed to
attribute it, the reality is, that Henry V, when he died, had not
effected reform on any comprehensive scale in his own realm; nor had
he given any decided blow to the dominion and the corruptions of the
church of Rome. His short life was a career of wars and victories.</p>

<p>It <span class="pagenum"><a id="page069" name="page069">(p. 069)</a></span>
pleased the Almighty, in his inscrutable wisdom, to bring
about the reformation of the church in his own way, by his own means,
and at his own appointed time. We recognise his hand in the blessing
which we have inherited, and are thankful.</p>

<span class="smcap">WARS WITH FRANCE.</span></h3>


<p>It falls not within the province of these Memoirs to justify the
proceedings of Henry of Monmouth with regard to France, by an
examination into the soundness of his claims, and the abstract
principles on which he and his subjects and advisers rested them. But
it is incumbent on any one who would estimate his character uprightly,
to weigh the considerations by which he was influenced in the
undertaking, neither according to our present standard, nor
independently of all the circumstances of the age in which he lived,
and the sentiments then generally prevalent among men of education and
reputed probity.</p>

<p>Historians
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page071" name="page071">(p. 071)</a></span>
have generally represented it as an established
fact that the clergy, especially the Archbishop of Canterbury, alarmed
at the bold and urgent call of the Commons upon the King to seize the
church patrimony, and from its proceeds apply whatever was required by
the exigencies of the state, hit upon the expedient of stimulating him
to claim France as his inheritance; thus withdrawing his mind from a
measure so fatal to their interests. Though the evidence on which such
a tradition rests is by no means satisfactory, we may perhaps receive
it as probable. That the Commons were clamorous for the confiscation
of the ecclesiastical revenues, and that the clergy voluntarily voted
a very large subsidy to aid the King in prosecuting his alleged rights
on the Continent, are matters of historical certainty. That the
ecclesiastics, moreover, originally suggested to him the design of
reviving his dormant claim to an inheritance in the fair realm of
France, and then fostered the thought, and justified the undertaking
by argument, and pledged their priestly word for the righteousness of
his cause, is doubtless no unreasonable supposition. Still the clergy
do not appear to have been in the least more eager in the scheme, or
more anxious to protect themselves and their revenues from spoliation
by such a scheme, than were the laity enthusiastically bent on a
harvest of national glory and aggrandizement from its
success.<a id="notetag064" name="notetag064"></a><a href="#note064">[64]</a> In
a word, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page072" name="page072">(p. 072)</a></span>
King himself, the nobles, and the people, all
seem to have been equally determined to engage in the enterprise, and
to support each other in the resolution that it was not only
practicable, but most fully justifiable by the laws of God and man.</p>

<p>That Henry's high spirit predisposed him to listen with readiness and
satisfaction to the suggestions of his subjects in this behalf, we may
well believe; but that he would have been driven by a dominant
ambition to engage in a war of conquest against the acknowledged
principles of justice, his character, firmly established by undeniable
proofs of a private as well as a public nature, forbids us to admit.
It must never be forgotten that those persons who were then
universally regarded as the best and safest interpreters of law, human
and divine, assured him, on his solemn appeal to them for their
judgment,<a id="notetag065" name="notetag065"></a><a href="#note065">[65]</a>
that the cause in which he was embarking was just;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page073" name="page073">(p. 073)</a></span>
and, as many incidents in the sequel establish, he did embark in
it without any doubts or misgivings, without the slightest scruple of
conscience; on the contrary, with a full confidence in the entire
righteousness of his cause, and a most unbounded reliance on the arm
of the God of Justice for success.</p>

<p>The facts which laid the groundwork for his enterprising spirit to
build upon are very interesting; and, though they may perhaps belong
rather to general history than to Memoirs of Henry of Monmouth, yet a
brief review of them might seem altogether indispensable in this
place.</p>

<p>"The preference given by the States-General to Philip of Valois above
Edward III, when he laid claim to the crown of France, led to that
disastrous war, the prominent incidents of which are familiar to every
one at all acquainted with the history of that time. Edward gained a
naval victory over the French, and conquered Philip at Cressy, and
possessed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page074" name="page074">(p. 074)</a></span>
himself of Calais, which gave him an entrance into
France at all times. After some interval, Edward the Black Prince, his
son, gained the famous battle of Poictiers; where King John, son and
successor of Philip of Valois, was taken prisoner. Whilst that monarch
was a captive in England, Edward entered France at the head of one
hundred thousand men, and marched to the very gates of Paris. This
successful invasion led to the treaty of Bretigny. By the terms of
that peace, Edward recovered all those ancient dependencies of Guienne
which had been wrested from his ancestors. These provinces had fallen
to the Kings of England by the marriage of Eleanor, heiress of
Guienne, with Henry II; but, from the time of John (Lackland) and
Henry III, Philip Augustus and St. Lewis, Kings of France, had so
shorn that vast territory, that nothing remained to England except
Bourdeaux, Bayonne, and Gascony. Besides, by the same treaty, Edward
secured Montreuil and Ponthieu, Calais and Guienne; and all these
possessions were ceded to him in full sovereignty without any suit or
homage due to France. Finally, he stipulated for the sum of three
millions of golden crowns as the ransom of King John. On his side, he
consented to forego all right and claim which he might have on the
crown of France. Especially he renounced all title to Normandy and
other places, which were said to be the heritage of his ancestors, and
to all the sovereignty of Brittany. This
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page075" name="page075">(p. 075)</a></span>
treaty was solemnly
executed by King John, and observed during his life, except as to the
ransom, two-thirds of which remained undischarged at his death. But
Charles V, his son and successor, finding this peace very
disadvantageous to France, though he had himself been a party to it,
and had sworn to observe its conditions, broke it on very frivolous
grounds. He declared war against Edward, and in a very few years
recovered all that had been ceded to England by the treaty of
Bretigny, except Calais, Bayonne, Bourdeaux, and part of Guienne. This
second war was interrupted by a truce, which continued till the death
of Edward III. in 1377. During the reign of Richard II, and the
remainder of Charles V.'s life, and the first years of Charles VI, war
and peace followed each other in mutual succession, without any
important or decided advantage on either side. At last, Richard II.
and Charles VI. concluded a truce for twenty-eight years, which was
ratified by the marriage of Richard with Isabel, Charles's daughter.
From the deposition of Richard to the death of Henry IV,
notwithstanding frequent violations of the truce, both sides
maintained that it still subsisted. Such was the state of the two
crowns when Henry of Monmouth mounted the throne. France having broken
the peace of Bretigny, and maintaining that the treaty was void,
evidently the Kings of England were reinstated in all their rights
which they had before that peace. On this principle, immediately
after <span class="pagenum"><a id="page076" name="page076">(p. 076)</a></span>
the disclaimer of that peace on the part of France,
Edward III. resumed the title of King of France, which he had laid
aside; and his successors assumed it also. Since the commencement of
the war which followed the treaty of Bretigny there never had been
peace between the two crowns, but only truces, which do not affect the
rights of the parties. It is evident, therefore, that, when he
ascended the throne, Henry V. found himself under precisely the same
circumstances in point of right in which his great grandfather, Edward
III, was eighty years before, when he commenced the first war. Besides
this, Henry had to allege a solemn treaty, which, after it had been
unequivocally acted upon, France broke on a most trifling pretext."</p>

<p>Such is the representation made by the author of the Abrégé
Historique<a id="notetag066" name="notetag066"></a><a href="#note066">[66]</a>
of the affairs of England; and the Author is desirous
of transferring into his pages this clear and candid statement the
rather because it is written by a foreigner, who seems to have viewed
the transaction with enlightened and unprejudiced eyes.</p>

<p>More modern writers, indeed, would teach us to deem it "unnecessary
for them to comment on the absurdity of Henry's claim to the French
crown in right of his descent from Isabella wife of Edward II. For
futile as her son Edward's (III.) pretensions were,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page077" name="page077">(p. 077)</a></span>
Henry's
were still less reasonable, as the Earl of March was in 1415 the heir
of those persons."<a id="notetag067" name="notetag067"></a><a
href="#note067">[67]</a></p>

<p>The fact on which this reasoning rests is undoubtedly true, and yet
considerations connected with that claim require to be entertained,
and weighed without haste and without prejudice; and the truth itself
warns us not to dismiss the point so summarily. Henry (it must never
be forgotten) had been bred up in the belief that Richard II. had in
the most full and unreserved manner, by his act of resignation,
yielded all his rights into the hands of the people of England, and
that those rights had been as fully and unreservedly conferred by the
nation on Henry's father. Whatever rights, moreover, the Earl of March
possessed as lineal heir to the crown, he had, as far as his own
personal interest was concerned, over and over again, not merely by a
passive acquiescence, but by repeated voluntary acts, virtually
resigned, and made over to Henry as actual King; and, lastly, it is
clear that Henry's claim was always by himself and by the nation
rested on the ground of his being King of England, and, ipso facto, as
such, heir of all his predecessors Kings of England.</p>

<p>On these grounds, and with such an opening offered to his ardent mind
by the distracted state of the realm of France, Henry resolved to
prefer his claim; negociating first for its amicable concession, and,
if unsuccessful in negociation, then pursuing it in the field of
battle. This appears to have been his determination from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page078" name="page078">(p. 078)</a></span>
the
first; but from the first he seems also to have contemplated the
probability of failure by treaty; for, from the first intimation of
his designs, he and his subjects were steadily engaged in making every
preparation<a id="notetag068" name="notetag068"></a><a href="#note068">[68]</a>
for a vigorous invasion of France.</p>

<p>In this part of our treatise a brief outline is required of the
proceedings between the resolution first taken by Henry, and his
appearance in arms on French land; nor can we satisfactorily pass on
without taking a succinct view of the internal state of that kingdom
at the time of Henry's original claim and subsequent invasion.</p>


<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">SUMMARY OF THE AFFAIRS OF FRANCE.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page079" name="page079">(p. 079)</a></span></p>

<p>Charles V, surnamed the Wise, died in
1380.<a id="notetag069" name="notetag069"></a><a href="#note069">[69]</a>
He left to succeed him
his son Charles VI, twelve years of age; and he appointed his three
brothers to govern the kingdom during the minority,&mdash;Lewis, Duke of
Anjou, John, Duke of Berry, and Philip, Duke of Burgundy, who by their
ambition and rivalry threw the whole realm into confusion. Charles V.
left also another son, called the Duke of Orleans, who in his time
contributed to the general confusion no less than his uncles. Through
the first days of Charles's (VI.) reign, the three regents, differing
in every other point, agreed only in burdening the nation with taxes;
a circumstance which bred great discontent, and prepared the people
for separating into different factions whenever an opportunity might
occur.</p>

<p>The Duke of Anjou quitted France in 1381, to take possession of his
kingdom of Sicily. The King was of age to be his own master, according
to the will of his father, at fourteen; yet his uncles governed both
his estate and his person till he was twenty. In 1385, he was married
to Isabella, daughter of Stephen, Duke of Bavaria.</p>

<p>In 1388, Charles assumed the reins of government, discharging his
uncles, and keeping about his person his brother, the Duke of Orleans,
then seventeen, and his maternal uncle the Duke of Bourbon.</p>

<p>The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page080" name="page080">(p. 080)</a></span>
Duke of Burgundy could not endure to see the Dukes of
Orleans and Bourbon govern the kingdom in the name of the King; and in
1391 he succeeded in causing the Estates-General to transfer the
government to him under the pretext of aiding his nephew to bear the
burden of the state. Probably the King had already shown symptoms of
that imbecility which afterwards incapacitated him altogether for
managing the affairs of his kingdom. In 1395 his malady increased in
violence; and for some time the Queen his wife, the Dukes of Orleans,
Berry, Burgundy, and Bourbon, each struggled hard to retain the reins
of government in their own hands. At length the Dukes of Orleans and
Burgundy formed two opposite parties; under the banners of which, as
well the members of the court, as the subjects of the kingdom at
large, arranged themselves in hostile ranks. Queen Isabella joined the
Duke of Orleans. The Duke of Berry fluctuated between the two
factions, and had great difficulty in preventing them from coming to
extremities. In these struggles the two chiefs were so equal, and so
determined not to yield either to the other, that they left the
government to the council of the King. The Duke of Burgundy withdrew
to the Netherlands, where he was master of the earldoms of Flanders
and Artois, and the duchy of Brabant: there he died in 1403, leaving
his son John to succeed him, who became Duke of Burgundy and Count of
Flanders and Artois. His brothers shared the residue of their father's
inheritance.</p>

<p>Whilst
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page081" name="page081">(p. 081)</a></span>
the new Duke of Burgundy was employed in arranging his
own affairs, the Queen and the Duke of Orleans conducted the
government; but with little satisfaction to the people, who found
themselves grievously oppressed by taxation. Meanwhile, the Duke of
Burgundy married his son Philip, Earl of Charolois, to Michelle, the
King's daughter; and one of his daughters was also espoused to the
Dauphin, Louis, then only nine years of age.</p>

<p>Some time afterwards, Charles VI. finding himself in one of his
intervals of mental health, and hearing complaints from all sides
against his Queen and the Duke of Orleans, convened an assembly of
nobles to deliberate on a remedy; and commanded the presence of the
Duke of Burgundy. On his approach, the Queen and the Duke of Orleans
withdrew, taking with them the young Dauphin. The Duke of Burgundy
followed, and overtook them; and rescued the Dauphin from their
custody. This was a source of open rupture between those princes.
There followed, indeed, an outward show of reconciliation; but their
mutual hatred was deadly still. In 1407 the Duke of Burgundy caused
the Duke of Orleans to be assassinated. He was bold enough to profess
himself the author of the murder, and powerful enough to shield
himself from any punishment, and to procure letters of free pardon.
Next year he was obliged to visit his own territory, and in his
absence his enemies caused the bill of amnesty to be reversed.</p>

<p>Meantime,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page082" name="page082">(p. 082)</a></span>
the Duke gained a victory over the troops of Liege,
and marched at the head of four thousand horsemen direct upon Paris.
The Queen withdrew at his approach, taking the King with her to Tours;
and, finding herself unable to cope with her antagonist, she consented
to an accommodation. The King received Burgundy, and reconciled him in
appearance to the Duke of Orleans, son of the murdered Duke. After
this, the Duke of Burgundy remained master of the government, and of
the person of the King.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that, in 1411, a powerful league was formed in
Guienne against the Duke of Burgundy, by the Dukes of Berry, Orleans,
Alençon, and the Count of Armagnac, who was governor of Languedoc and
father-in-law to the Duke of Berry; and who, being the chief conductor
of the whole affair, gave the name of Armagnacs to the party in
general opposed to
Burgundy.<a id="notetag070" name="notetag070"></a><a href="#note070">[70]</a>
At the beginning, the Duke of
Burgundy, having received succours from Henry IV. of England, gained a
great advantage over his opponents. Subsequently, the Armagnacs,
obtaining considerable assistance from the same King, forced the Duke
of Burgundy, who was besieging them in Bourges, to make peace; one
condition of which, however, being that no one of those chiefs should
return to the court, the Duke of Burgundy still remained master of the
King's person. In
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page083" name="page083">(p. 083)</a></span>
this state of triumph on the part of the
Duke of Burgundy, and of depression of the Armagnacs, another opponent
arose against the Duke, of whom he seems to have been previously under
no apprehension,&mdash;the Dauphin himself, his son-in-law, then only
sixteen years of age. This prince, persuaded that during his father's
illness the government could of right belong to no one but himself,
resolved to secure his own. He gained over the governor of the
Bastille, and seized that fortress. The Parisians flew to arms at the
secret instigation of the Duke of Burgundy. A surgeon, named John of
Troyes, at the head of ten or twelve thousand men, forced the gates of
the Dauphin's palace; and, carrying off the chief friends of that
prince, lodged them in prison.</p>

<p>These events took place at the opening of the year 1413, whilst Henry
IV. was labouring under the malady of which he died. Henry V.
succeeded to the throne, March 20th of that year. At the end of April,
the malcontents of Paris, all of the Burgundian faction, committed
various excesses, and compelled both the King and the Dauphin to wear
the white cap, the badge of their party. The
Dauphin<a id="notetag071" name="notetag071"></a><a href="#note071">[71]</a>
betook
himself at last to the Armagnacs, of whom many lived in Paris,
grievously oppressed by the government of the Duke of Burgundy; and he
planned his scheme so well, and so secretly, that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page084" name="page084">(p. 084)</a></span>
at the
beginning of September he found thirty thousand men in Paris ready to
support him. By his sudden and vigorous efforts he struck terror into
the opposite faction, who abandoned the Bastille and other places in
their possession, and thought of nothing but their own personal
safety. The Duke of Burgundy himself withdrew to Flanders. The
Dauphin, however, gained no permanent advantage from this success; for
the King, in one of his favourable intervals, immediately seized the
reins of government, and called his nephew the young Duke of Orleans
to his counsels. This youth induced the King to issue very violent
decrees against the Duke of Burgundy, and to execute a great number of
his partisans.</p>

<p>Such was the state of affairs in France when Henry of Monmouth first
resolved to prosecute his claims in that kingdom. The Duke of Burgundy
lost no time in endeavouring to secure the assistance of so powerful
an ally; as we find by the many safe-conducts dated before the Duke's
expulsion from Paris, which did not take place till September. Whether
Henry had, before these embassies from the Duke of Burgundy, formed
any design of claiming his supposed rights in France, or not, the
Duke's negociations must have strongly impressed him with the
distracted state of that country, and with an opening offered to the
enterprising spirit of any powerful neighbour who would promptly and
vigorously seize upon that opportunity of invading France.</p>

<p>"Although<a id="notetag072" name="notetag072"></a><a href="#note072">[72]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page085" name="page085">(p. 085)</a></span>
several negociations had taken place between
September 1413, and the January following, for the purpose of
prolonging the subsisting truce between England and France, it was not
until January 28, 1414, that ambassadors were appointed to treat of
peace. From the engagement then made, that Henry would not propose
marriage to any other woman than Katharine, daughter of the King of
France, until after the 1st of the ensuing May, (which term was
extended from the 18th of June to the 1st of August, and afterwards to
the 2nd of February 1415,) it is evident that a marriage with that
princess was to form one of the conditions of the treaty. But the
first intimation of a claim to the crown of France is in a commission,
dated May 1, 1414, by which the Bishop of Durham, Richard Lord Grey,
and others, were instructed to negociate that alliance, and the
restitution of such of their sovereign's rights as were withheld by
Charles. The principal claim was no less than the crown and kingdom of
France. Concession to this demand, however, being at once declared
impossible, the English ambassadors waived it, without prejudice
nevertheless to Henry's rights. They then demanded the sovereignty of
the duchies of Normandy and Touraine, the earldom of Anjou, the duchy
of Brittany, the earldom of Flanders, with all other parts of the
duchy of Aquitain, the territories which had been ceded
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page086" name="page086">(p. 086)</a></span>
to
Edward III. by the treaty of Bretigny, and the lands between the Somme
and Graveline; to be held by Henry and his heirs, without any claim of
superiority on the part of Charles or his successors. To these demands
were added the cession of the county of Provence, and payment of the
arrears of the ransom of King John, amounting to one million six
hundred thousand crowns. It was also intimated that the marriage with
Katharine could not take place, unless a firm peace were also
established with France, and that two millions of crowns would be
expected as her dower.</p>

<p>On March 14, 1415, the French ministers denied Henry's right to any
part of the dominion of their master; but, to avoid extremities, they
offered to cede the counties of Angouleme and Bayonne, with various
other territories. They said that Provence, not being among Charles's
lordships, was not withheld by him. With respect to the arrears of
ransom, they thought that, having offered so much to extend the
possessions of England, with a view of securing peace, the claim ought
to be withdrawn. Touching the marriage, which had been so frequently
discussed, though the Kings of France had been accustomed to give much
less with their daughters than six hundred thousand crowns, which sum
the Duke of Berry had offered with her in the preceding August, yet
that it should be enlarged to eight hundred thousand crowns, besides
her jewels and apparel, and the expense of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page087" name="page087">(p. 087)</a></span>
sending the
princess in a suitable manner to the place where she might be
delivered to Henry. But as the English ambassadors said they were not
permitted to prolong their stay in France, and had no authority to
vary their demands, Charles engaged to send an embassy to England to
conclude the treaty.</p>

<p>During the progress of these protracted negociations Henry grew
dissatisfied; and either from impatience, or with a view of awing
France into submission, issued writs of 26th September 1414, for a
parliament to be held at Westminster after the Octaves of St. Martin,
18th November following. On that day parliament met; and the session
was opened at the command of the King by Henry Beaufort, Bishop of
Winchester, then Chancellor. In a long harangue he informed the
assembly, that their King (who was present in person) had resolved to
recover his inheritance, which had been so long and unjustly kept from
him and his progenitors, Kings of England; and that, for this purpose,
many things were necessary. Taking for his theme the text, "Whilst we
have time, let us do good," he pointed out, with more pedantry than
eloquence, that for every natural thing there were two seasons; and
that just as for the tree there was one time to bud, to flower, and to
bring forth fruit, and another time through which it was left to
repose, so was there given to man a time for peace, and a time for war
and labour: that the King,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page088" name="page088">(p. 088)</a></span>
considering the value of peace
and tranquillity which this kingdom then enjoyed, and also the justice
of his present quarrel, (considerations most necessary for every
prince who had to encounter enemies abroad,) deemed that the proper
time had arrived for the accomplishment of his purpose. But, to attain
this great and honourable object, three things, he said, were wanted;
namely, wise and faithful counsel from his vassals, strong and true
support from his people, and a copious subsidy from his subjects;
which each of them would readily grant, because the more their
prince's dominions were extended, the less would their burdens become;
and, these things being performed, great honour and glory would
necessarily ensue.</p>

<p>This address was not without effect, for the Commons, after electing
Thomas Chaucer (son, as it is said, of the poet) for their Speaker,
"granted the King, for the honour of God, and from the great love and
affection which they bore towards their sovereign, two entire
fifteenths and two entire tenths, <i>for the defence of the kingdom of
England and the safeguard of the seas</i>."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">modern triple charge against henry of falsehood, hypocrisy, and
impiety. &mdash; futility of the charge, and utter failure of the evidence
on which alone it is grounded. &mdash; he is urged by his people to
vindicate the rights of his crown, himself having a conscientious

<p>At this point of his work, the Author finds the painful duty devolved
upon him of investigating a triple charge, now for the first time
brought against Henry by a living writer. He must not shrink from the
task, though he enter upon it with a consciousness that, if
established, the charge must brand Henry's memory with indelible
disgrace, whilst his acquittal may imply censure on his
accuser.<a id="notetag073" name="notetag073"></a><a href="#note073">[73]</a>
He feels, nevertheless, that only one course is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page090" name="page090">(p. 090)</a></span>
open for him
to pursue; he must follow up the inquiry fully, fearlessly, and
impartially, whatever may be the result; and, whether he looks to
Henry or his accuser, he must adhere rigidly to the golden maxim,
"Friends are dear, but truth is dearer!"</p>

<p>An Author,<a id="notetag074" name="notetag074"></a><a href="#note074">[74]</a>
then, to whom (as we gladly and gratefully acknowledge)
we are largely indebted for many helps supplied to the biographer and
historian, and from whom we have borrowed copiously in this part of
our work, brings a wide and violent charge against Henry's character
in those very points on which the general tenour and complexion of his
whole life would lead us to regard him as of all least assailable. He
charges him with <i>falsehood</i>, <i>hypocrisy</i>, and <i>impiety</i>. The
groundwork on which he founds these accusations is a series of letters
recorded in M. Le Laboureur's History of Charles VI. of France.</p>

<p>To <span class="pagenum"><a id="page091" name="page091">(p. 091)</a></span>
ascertain more satisfactorily whether the charge is really
substantiated, or whether it has been built upon an unsound
foundation, we will first extract the whole passage as it stands in
his work, "The Battle of Agincourt," and then sift the evidence which
the writer alleges in support of so grave an imputation.</p>

<p>"On the 7th April, Henry is said to have addressed the King of France
on the subject of his claims, and in reference to the embassy which
Charles had signified his intention of sending to discuss them. No
part<a id="notetag075" name="notetag075"></a><a href="#note075">[75]</a>
of the correspondence on this occasion occurs in the
F&oelig;dera, and it is very slightly alluded to by our historians. "To
the first of those letters Charles replied on the 16th of April, and
to the last on the 26th of that month; it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page092" name="page092">(p. 092)</a></span>
is therefore
evident that Henry did not wait for the answer to the first before the
second was written. These documents occur in contemporary writers;
and, as the internal evidence which they contain of being genuine is
very strong, there is no cause to doubt their authenticity. Their most
striking features are falsehood, hypocrisy, and impiety; for Henry's
solemn assurance that he was not actuated by his own ambition, but by
the wishes of his subjects, is rendered very doubtful by the fact
that, on the day after the Chancellor had solicited supplies for the
invasion of France, the Commons <i>merely stated</i> that they granted
<i>them for the defence of the realm, and the safety of the seas</i>. The
justice claimed was, that France should be dismembered of many
important territories; and that, with the hand of Katharine, Henry
should receive a sum as unprecedented as it was exorbitant. But this
was not all, for his first demand was the crown of France itself; and
it was not until he was convinced of the impossibility of such a
concession, that he required those points to which his letters refer.
If then there was <span class="smcap">falsehood</span> in his assertion that his demands were
dictated by the wishes of his people rather than by his own, there was
<span class="smcap">hypocrisy</span> in the assurances of his moderation and love of peace, and
<span class="smcap">impiety</span> in calling the Almighty to witness the sincerity of his
protestation, and in profaning the holy writings by citing them on
such an occasion. These letters, which were probably dictated by
Cardinal <span class="pagenum"><a id="page093" name="page093">(p. 093)</a></span>
Beaufort, are remarkable for the style in which
they are written; in some places they approach nearly to eloquence,
and they are throughout clear, nervous, and impressive."</p>

<p>In this threefold indictment, the first charge is "falsehood." The
falsehood is made to consist in Henry's assertion, that he was
stimulated to prosecute his claim by the wishes of his people; and the
only evidence alleged to sustain this charge of falsehood, is the fact
that parliament, in granting the supplies, so far from specifying that
the grant was made for the purpose of recovering the King's rights in
France, merely stated that it was "<i>for the defence of the realm, and
the safety of the seas</i>."</p>

<p>Before a charge, fixing an indelible stain on the character of a
fellow-creature, whether the individual were a king leading his armies
to victory, or the humblest subject in his realm, were made on such
grounds as these, it had been well,&mdash;well for the cause of truth, and
well for the satisfaction of the accuser,&mdash;had the nature and force of
the evidence adduced been first more carefully examined. The slightest
acquaintance with the language of parliament at that time, and the
most cursory comparison of the words of its members with their
conduct, must satisfy every one that not a shadow of suspicion is
suggested of any unwillingness on the part of the Commons to support
the King in demanding his supposed rights, and vindicating them by
arms. On the contrary, the very records of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page094" name="page094">(p. 094)</a></span>
parliament
themselves, which are cited to maintain against Henry the charge of
falsehood, carry with them a full and perfect refutation of the
accusation, complete in all its parts; and compel us to lament that it
has been brought so hastily, unadvisedly, and inconsiderately. Our
first point is to ascertain the force of those words in the grant
alone cited to substantiate the charge of falsehood against
Henry,&mdash;what meaning was attached to them by the Commons themselves.
We shall find that the subsidy was granted in the usual formal words,
"for the defence of the realm of England and so forth." In the first
parliament of Henry for example, the subsidy is granted in these
words: "To the honour of God, and for the great love and affection
which your poor Commons of your realm of England have to you our dread
sovereign Lord, for the good of the realm and its good governance in
time to come, we have, with the consent of the Lords Spiritual and
Temporal, granted to you <i>for defence of your realm of England</i>," and
so forth,&mdash;specifying a subsidy from wools and other merchandise; and
then, in voting an entire fifteenth and a tenth, they add, "for <i>the
defence of the realm, and the safeguard of the seas</i>." With precisely
the same justice might it be argued in this case that the Commons
would not vote the subsidy for "the support of the King's dignity and
high estate," (though that was one of the especial grounds on which he
appealed himself to the liberality of his parliament,) as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page095" name="page095">(p. 095)</a></span> it
can be inferred, from the same words used in the parliament of 1415,
that the Commons of England were not forward to promote the expedition
to France. In that parallel case, however, we are quite sure the
argument would be fallacious; because in the very same session they
voted that the King's own allowance should take precedence of all
other payments of annuities and other demands, to the amount of
10,000<i>l.</i> annually.</p>

<p>Another instance occurs in the parliament which met October 19, 1416,
the King himself presiding: though the Chancellor, after referring
with exultation to the victories of Harfleur, "the key of France," and
of Agincourt, "where greatest part of the chivalry of France had
fallen in battle," asks for new supplies <i>for the express purpose</i> of
carrying on the wars in France; the Commons, in voting those supplies,
as expressly state that they grant them "<i>for the defence of your
realm of England</i>."</p>

<p>The same conclusion is warranted by the grants of 1417 and 1419;
excepting that in these the Commons make the argument intended to
support the charge against Henry's veracity still less tenable, by
inserting a phrase which might seem to exclude the very object for
which application for the subsidy was made. The application was made
especially for the supplies necessary to carry on the war abroad; the
Commons vote the subsidy "for the defence of the realm of England <i>in
especial</i>."</p>

<p>But, to remove all possible doubt as to the true intent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page096" name="page096">(p. 096)</a></span> and
meaning of the people of England in the grant in 1414 of two entire
tenths and two entire fifteenths, we need only refer to the first act
of the next parliament, which, after rehearsing the impossibility of
the King effectually carrying on his wars abroad unless one tenth and
one fifteenth made by the former parliament, payable on the 2nd of
February, should be collected before that time, decrees that subsidy
to be due and payable on the feast of St. Lucie in the next coming
December. Nor is this all. The next act of this same parliament would
of itself prove the utter futility of the charge against Henry, as far
as that charge rests upon the evidence adduced. The parliament first
state the necessity of supplying the King with more efficient means
<i>for pursuing his campaign in France</i>, and then vote one entire tenth
and one entire fifteenth,&mdash;for what? not for the purpose which they
have expressly specified, but "<i>for the defence of his said realm of
England</i>." The preamble, however, of this act shows so clearly what
were the views and feelings of his subjects on this very point, as
well as on the justice of his claim, that a transcript of it seems
indispensable in this place.</p>

<p>"The Commons of the realm, in this present parliament assembled,
considering that the King our sovereign lord, for the honour of God,
and to avoid the shedding of human blood, hath caused various requests
to be made to his adversary of France to have restitution of his
<i>inheritance</i> according to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page097" name="page097">(p. 097)</a></span>
<i>right and
justice</i>;<a id="notetag076" name="notetag076"></a><a href="#note076">[76]</a>
and for
that end there have been diverse treaties, as well here as beyond the
sea, to his great costs; nevertheless he hath not, by such requests
and treaties, obtained his said inheritance, nor any important part
thereof: and since the King, neither by the revenues of his realm, nor
by any previous grant of subsidy, hath had enough wherewith to pursue
<i>his right</i>; yet, always <i>trusting in God</i> that in his <span class="smcap">just</span> <i>quarrel</i>
he shall be upheld and supported, of his own good courage hath
undertaken an expedition into those parts, pawning his jewels to
procure a supply of money, and in his own person hath passed over, and
arrived at Harfleur, and laid siege to it and taken it, and holds it
at present, having placed lords and many others there for its defence;
and then of his excellent courage, with few people in regard to the
power of France, he marched by land towards Calais, where, on his
route, many dukes, earls, and other lords, with the power of the realm
of France, to an exceeding great number, opposed him, and gave him
battle; and God, of his grace, hath given victory to our King, to the
honour and exaltation of his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page098" name="page098">(p. 098)</a></span>
crown, of his own fair fame, the
singular comfort of his faithful lieges, to the terror of all his
enemies, and probably to the lasting profit of all his realm."</p>

<p>We may safely leave the issue to the verdict of any impartial mind.
The argument drawn from the language of parliament to convict Henry of
falsehood falls to the ground; it has no colour of reason in it; and
no other argument is even alluded to by the accuser. It is, moreover,
much to be regretted that the Editor of "The Battle of Agincourt,"
when he was translating so large a portion of the Chaplain's memoir,
which with great reason he implicitly follows, had not begun the work
of translation a few sentences only before its present commencement.
Our countrymen would then have seen that, from whatever sources that
Editor drew the evidence on which to build his triple charge of
hypocrisy, falsehood, and impiety against Henry V, those who knew him
best, and had the most ample opportunities of witnessing his character
and conduct, expressed at least a very opposite opinion on the point
at issue. The following are the genuine words of one who accompanied
Henry from his native shores to France, was with him at the battle of
Agincourt, and returned with him in safety to England. "Meanwhile,
after the interchange of many solemn embassies between England and
France, with a view to permanent peace, when the King found that very
many negociations and most exact
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page099" name="page099">(p. 099)</a></span>
treaties had been carried
on in vain, by reason that the council of France, <i>clinging to their
own will, which they adopted as their law</i>, could be induced to peace
by no just mean of equity, without immense injury to the crown of
England, and perpetual disinheritance of some of the noblest portions
of his right in that realm, though for the sake of peace he was ready
to make great concessions, seeing no other remedy or means by which he
could come to his right, had recourse to the sentence of the supreme
judicature, and without blame sought to recover by the sword what the
blameworthy and unjust violence of the French had struggled so long to
usurp and keep.... He determined to regain the duchy of Normandy,
which had for a long time been <i>kept, against God and all justice, by
the violence of the French</i>."</p>

<p>There is, however, one declaration contained in the very volume from
which these alleged letters of Henry are extracted, which makes the
charge brought by the commentator on those letters still more
surprising.<a id="notetag077" name="notetag077"></a><a href="#note077">[77]</a>
It is in that very volume positively asserted, with
regard to the first rumour through France of Henry's intended
invasion, that "his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name="page100">(p. 100)</a></span>
subjects <i>had strongly</i> remonstrated with
him for his love of peace and rest, and his dislike of active
measures, and had <i>now</i> <span class="smcap">insisted</span> upon his undertaking the
expedition."<a id="notetag078" name="notetag078"></a><a href="#note078">[78]</a></p>

<p>The charge of hypocrisy is made to rest "on Henry assuring the French
monarch of his moderation and love of peace, whereas he must have been
conscious that he was immoderate in his demands, and was not desirous
of peace." To prove that his demands were immoderate, is not enough to
sustain this accusation; to constitute him a hypocrite, he must
<i>himself have been conscious</i> that his demands were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page101" name="page101">(p. 101)</a></span>
immoderate. But how stands the probability? He was fully persuaded
that the crown of France was his own; and he first demands the full
surrender of his alleged rights. The Commons declare that what he
sought was "the restitution of his inheritance according to <i>right and
justice</i>," and testify that he "trusted in God for support in his
<i>just quarrel</i>." He then, agreeably to the advice of his
council,<a id="notetag079" name="notetag079"></a><a href="#note079">[79]</a>
(who acknowledge that what he sought to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page102" name="page102">(p. 102)</a></span>
recover was "his
righteous heritage, the redintegration of the old rights of his
crown,") withdrawing his full demand, proposes other terms,
unreasonable, no
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page103" name="page103">(p. 103)</a></span>
doubt, as we may view them now, but, if
regarded as a substitute for the fair kingdom of France, far from
stamping on Henry the brand of hypocrisy, when he made a profession of
moderation and a love of
peace.<a id="notetag080" name="notetag080"></a><a href="#note080">[80]</a></p>

<p>There remains the charge of impiety, which is made to rest on Henry
having called the Almighty to witness a falsehood, and quoted
Scripture in support of what he affirmed. It was undoubtedly too much
the practice then, as unhappily it is now, for Christians, on trivial
occasions, to appeal to Heaven, and to quote the sanction of Scripture
in very questionable matters of worldly policy. But Henry does not
appeal presumptuously, nor quote lightly; he appeals solemnly, and he
quotes reverently, in a matter of very great importance to both
kingdoms, and in a cause which he believed to be founded in right and
justice. He appealed to Heaven to witness what he regarded as true.
The page we have been examining accuses Henry of falsehood, hypocrisy,
and impiety: the evidence of facts, and the testimony of his
contemporaries, represent him to us in the character of an honest,
undisguised, and pious King.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, April 16, Henry held a council at Westminster,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page104" name="page104">(p. 104)</a></span>
at which the Chancellor, Henry Beaufort, briefly explained the
proceedings of the great council, enumerating the causes which induced
their King, in the name of God, to undertake in his own person an
expedition for the recovery of his inheritance. On the next day the
Chancellor informed the council that the King had appointed the Duke
of Bedford to be lieutenant of
England<a id="notetag081" name="notetag081"></a><a href="#note081">[81]</a>
during his absence; with
the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of Winchester, and other
prelates and lay lords to form his council.</p>

<p>As early as May 26, an order was issued to suspend the assizes through
England during the King's absence, lest his lieges who accompanied him
might be subjected to inconvenience and injustice. The defence of the
country towards Scotland and Wales was provided for, and the rate of
wages payable to his retinue and soldiers was fixed. Every duke was to
receive 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, every earl 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, every baron 4<i>s.</i>, and
every knight 2<i>s.</i>, every esquire being a man-at-arms 12<i>d.</i>, every
archer 6<i>d.</i> each day; whilst for every thirty men-at-arms a reward
was assigned of one hundred marks a quarter; together with some other
stipulations.</p>

<p>In <span class="pagenum"><a id="page105" name="page105">(p. 105)</a></span>
the spring and summer the King
issued<a id="notetag082" name="notetag082"></a><a href="#note082">[82]</a>
commissions to
hire ships from Holland and Zealand; to press sailors to navigate his
vessels; to provide workmen to make and repair bows; to procure carts
and waggons for the conveyance of his stores; also a supply of masons,
carpenters, and smiths, together with the materials of the respective
trades. The sheriffs of different counties were ordered to buy cattle;
and the sheriff of Hampshire was to cause bread to be baked, and ale
to be brewed, at Winchester and Southampton, and the parts adjacent,
for the use of the army.</p>

<p>The King not only thus took effective measures for the transport and
supply of his forces, but commanded also the Archbishop and the other
prelates to array the clergy for the defence of the kingdom at home
during his absence. Every sheriff also was to proclaim that a nightly
watch should be kept till All-Saints' Day; and no taverner was to
allow any stranger to remain in his house more than one day and night,
without knowledge of the cause of his delay; and all suspicious
persons were to be committed to prison.</p>

<p>Though parliament had granted a liberal supply, the King, finding his
expenses to exceed his means, made a direct and powerful appeal to all
his <span class="pagenum"><a id="page106" name="page106">(p. 106)</a></span>
loving subjects for a loan, with promise of repayment;
and a considerable sum was raised in consequence of that appeal, but
still not enough. He was, therefore, compelled to pawn his plate and
jewels, (as he had done with his small stock in early youth during the
Welsh rebellion,) and to have recourse to all expedients for raising
the necessary sums. These expedients were often totally incompatible
with our present notions of the royal dignity; but no intimation
appears anywhere of the least unfair and dishonourable dealing on the
part of the King. His appeals to the people much resembled those of
Charles I, under still more urgent circumstances, in after ages.</p>

<p>A curious fact is recorded in the minutes of a council held May 25,
1415, respecting a demand for money from the companies of foreign
merchants resident in London. They were summoned before the council,
and informed that it was usual for merchants who traded in any other
country than their own to lend the government such sums as they could
bear, or else be committed to prison during pleasure. This custom was
justified on the ground of many and great privileges secured to them
in their traffic by the King's favour, from which they derived great
wealth. Certain sums were demanded, and sufficient pledges of gold,
silver, and jewels were offered; but the merchants of Florence,
Venice, and Lucca [de Luk] refused to comply, and were committed to
the custody of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page107" name="page107">(p. 107)</a></span>
warden of the Fleet Prison. From the
merchants of Florence was required 1,200<i>l.</i>, from those of Venice
1,000<i>l.</i>, from those of Lucca 200<i>l.</i> These strong measures seem to
have worked their intended effect, for all those guilds granted loans
afterwards.</p>

<p>Having now effected every preparation in his power, the King passed
through London, accompanied by the Mayor and citizens (who attended
him as far as Kingston); and having made an offering at St. Paul's,
and taken leave of his mother-in-law the Queen, he proceeded on his
way towards Southampton, where all his ships and contingents were
directed to await his arrival.</p>

<p>Reaching Winchester, he remained there for some days from June 26th,
probably to give audience to the French ambassadors, who were
presented to him on the 30th. The Archbishop of Bourges headed that
embassy, and the Bishop of Winchester was Henry's representative and
spokesman. Much of negociating and bartering ensued, and at first many
conciliatory communications were made on both sides; the French
yielding much, the English adhering to their original demands, or
remitting little from them. At length, the reply of the Archbishop put
an abrupt end to further discussion; and Henry commanded the
ambassadors to depart, with a promise that he would soon follow them.</p>

<p>It is here again painful to read the unkind and unjustifiable language
of the same author, whose triple
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page108" name="page108">(p. 108)</a></span>
charge against Henry's
religious and moral character we have just investigated, when he
describes the surprise of the French monarch and his court on the
return of these ambassadors. "Until that moment," he says, "the French
court, either <i>cajoled</i> by Henry's <i>hypocrisy</i>, or lulled into
security by a mistaken estimate of his power, had neglected every
means for resisting the storm which was about to burst upon their
country." Henry stands convicted of no hypocrisy; and his accuser
alleges no evidence on which an impartial mind would pronounce him
guilty. It is curious as it is satisfactory to lay side by side with
this unguarded calumny the version of the circumstances of that time,
made by an unprejudiced foreigner, and a very sensible well-versed
historian.<a id="notetag083" name="notetag083"></a><a href="#note083">[83]</a>
"France was then governed by the Dauphin Louis, a young
and presumptuous prince, who had up to this point thought himself able
to amuse Henry by feigned negociations. Nevertheless, the preparations
going on in England having opened the eyes of his council, a
resolution was taken to send to England twelve ambassadors, at the
head of whom was the Archbishop of Bourges."</p>

<p>Several contemporary writers, as well as general tradition, state
that, on occasion of one of the various embassies sent to and fro
between the courts of London and Paris, the Dauphin, then about
eighteen or nineteen years of age, sent an insulting present
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page109" name="page109">(p. 109)</a></span>
to Henry of a tun of tennis-balls, with a message full of contempt and
scorn,<a id="notetag084" name="notetag084"></a><a href="#note084">[84]</a>
implying that a racket-court was a more fit place for him
than a battle-field. It is well observed, that such an act of wilful
provocation must have convinced both parties of the hopelessness of
any attempts towards a pacific arrangement; and, since the
negociations were carried on to the very last, some discredit has
thence been attempted to be thrown on the story altogether. But it
must be remembered (as the author of the Abrégé Historique justly
remarks) that these negociations were continued, on the part of
France, merely to gain time, and withdraw Henry from his purpose;
whilst Henry, on the other side, by his renewed proposals for the hand
of Katharine, (an union on which he appears from the first to have
been heartily bent,) kept up in his enemies the hope that, to gain
that object, he would ultimately relax from many of his original
demands. Henry certainly afterwards challenged the Dauphin to single
combat, as though he had a quarrel with him personally; and nothing
can fairly be inferred against the truth of the tradition, from the
silence in the challenge on the point of such an insult having been
offered. On the whole, the evidence is decidedly in favour of the
reality of the incident; whilst Henry's reported answer is very
characteristic: "I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page110" name="page110">(p. 110)</a></span>
will thank the Dauphin in person, and will
carry him such tennis-balls as shall rattle his hall's roof about his
ears." And they, says the contemporary
chronicler,<a id="notetag085" name="notetag085"></a><a href="#note085">[85]</a>
were great
gunstones for the Dauphin to play withal.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>Anxious to proceed in our narrative without further allusion to such
sweeping and unsupported charges, we must, nevertheless, here
introduce (though reluctantly) the remarks which have been suffered to
fall from the same pen, as its chief comment on the closing words of
Henry's last Will, made at this
time.<a id="notetag086" name="notetag086"></a><a href="#note086">[86]</a>
He signed that document at
Southampton, July 24th, just three days after discovering the
conspiracy of which we must soon speak. Probably a sense of the
uncertainty of life, and the necessity of setting his house in order
without delay, were impressed deeply upon him by that unhappy event.
He felt not only that he had embarked in an enterprise the result of
which was doubtful, in which at all events he must expose his life to
numberless unforeseen perils; but that the thread of his mortal
existence might at a moment be cut asunder by the hands of the very
men to whom he looked for protection and victory. Compared with the
wills of other princes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page111" name="page111">(p. 111)</a></span>
and nobles of that day, there is
nothing very remarkable in Henry's. From first to last it is tinctured
with the superstitions of the corrupt form of our holy religion, then
over-spreading
England.<a id="notetag087" name="notetag087"></a><a href="#note087">[87]</a></p>

<p>The subscription to this testament is couched in these words: "This
is my last Will subscribed with my own hand. R.H. Jesu Mercy and
Gramercy Ladie Mary Help:" and on these words the same author makes
this observation: "According to all the biographers of Henry,
extraordinary piety was a leading trait in his character, from which
feeling the addition to his Will appears to have arisen. It seems
indeed difficult to reconcile the <i>lawless ambition</i>, much less the
<i>hypocrisy</i>,<a id="notetag088" name="notetag088"></a><a href="#note088">[88]</a>
which Henry displayed in his negociations, with an
obedience to the genuine dictates
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page112" name="page112">(p. 112)</a></span>
of Christianity; but as he
rigidly observed every rite of the church, was bountiful towards its
members, and uniformly ascribed success to the Almighty, it is not
surprising that his contemporaries should have described him as
eminently pious."</p>

<p>On this passage the biographer of Henry had rather that his readers
should form their own comment, than that he should express the
sentiments which he cannot but entertain: he invites, however, the
lover of truth to compare this charge of <i>lawless ambition and
hypocrisy</i> with the actual conduct of Henry at this very time.</p>

<p>Whilst resident in the Abbey of
Tichfield,<a id="notetag089" name="notetag089"></a><a href="#note089">[89]</a>
about ten miles from
Southampton, he despatched to the Council of Constance, addressing
himself chiefly to the Emperor Sigismund and the other princes
assembled there, copies of the treaties between Henry IV. and the
French court relative to the restoration of Aquitain to the English
crown; remarking upon the wrong that was done to him by the gross
violation of those treaties. This shows at all events that he was not
conscious of being actuated by lawless ambition, or of acting the part
of a hypocrite; it proves that he was desirous of having the merits of
his quarrel with France examined and understood: and he seems to have
felt an assurance that those who made themselves acquainted with the
real grounds of his intended invasion would pronounce his quarrel to
be just. Otherwise he would scarcely have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page113" name="page113">(p. 113)</a></span>
gone out of his way
to draw the eyes of assembled Europe, (not to the boldness of an
enterprise, nor to the splendour of conquests, but) to a calm
investigation of the righteousness of his
cause.<a id="notetag090" name="notetag090"></a><a href="#note090">[90]</a></p>

<p>The words of his chaplain in recording this measure of Henry deserve a
place here. Indeed, every page of contemporary history proves that the
King himself had no misgivings as to the uprightness and justice of
his cause, and was ready to refer the whole to the judgment of
Christendom. "The King caused transcripts of all treaties to be
forwarded to the general council, to the Emperor Sigismund and other
Catholic princes, to the intent that all Christendom might know how
great injuries the duplicity of the French had inflicted upon him, and
that he was, reluctantly and against his will, compelled, as it were,
to raise his standard against the
rebels."<a id="notetag091" name="notetag091"></a><a href="#note091">[91]</a></p>

<p>Nor <span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name="page114">(p. 114)</a></span>
can we here omit to observe, (though it be anticipating
what must hereafter be again referred to in the course of the
history,) that the behaviour of the Emperor, when, in the spring of
the following year, he made a personal voyage to England on purpose to
visit Henry, and the solemn declaration of the Duke of Burgundy, (of
whose sincerity, however, no one can speak without hesitation,) "that
he had at first thought Henry unjust in his demands, but was at length
convinced of their justice," show that in the estimation of
contemporaries, and those neither churchmen nor his own subjects, who
may be suspected of partiality, Henry's character deserved better than
to be stamped with the imputation of "lawless ambition and hypocrisy."
It is very easy for any one to charge a fellow-creature with immoral
and unchristian motives; and it may carry with it the appearance of
honest indignation, and of an heroic love of virtue, religion, and
truth, when one can tear off the veil of conquest and martial glory
from the individual, and expose his naked faults to pity, or contempt,
or hatred. But a good judge, in forming his own estimate of the
motives which may have given birth to acts which fall under his
cognizance, or in guiding others to return a righteous verdict, will
not consider the most ready method of solving a difficulty to be
always the safest.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page115" name="page115">(p. 115)</a></span>
Take for granted that Henry's conduct
towards France is intelligible on the ground of lawless ambition and
gross hypocrisy, (though there is no proof of either,) it is equally,
at least, intelligible on the supposition of his full and undoubting
conviction of his right to all he claimed. And just as open would any
individual plaintiff be to the charge of hypocrisy, who, after having
insisted upon his full rights, and given notice of trial, and
collected his witnesses, should, on the very eve of the issue being
tried, write to the defendant, urging him to yield, and avoid the
expense and irritation of a protracted law-suit, offering at the same
time a remission of some portion of his claim,&mdash;as Henry is in
fairness chargeable with hypocrisy because he wrote to his "adversary
of France," urging him to yield, and avoid the effusion of blood. On
the very eve of his departure for the shores of Normandy, many facts
and circumstances assure us that Henry acted under a full persuasion
that he demanded of France only what was in strict justice his due
when he laid claim to those territories and honours which had been so
long withheld from the Kings of England, his predecessors. Facts are
decidedly against the charge of hypocrisy; but, even were the facts
doubtful, his general character for honesty, and openness, and manly
straightforward dealing, (to which history bears abundant evidence,)
would make the scale of justice preponderate in his favour.</p>

<p>In <span class="pagenum"><a id="page116" name="page116">(p. 116)</a></span>
dismissing this subject, parallel with these modern
accusations of Henry on the ground of "cajoling hypocrisy" we may lay
the testimony borne by his contemporary,
Walsingham,<a id="notetag092" name="notetag092"></a><a href="#note092">[92]</a>
to the
unsuspecting simplicity of his mind, which exposed him to

cunning craftiness and hypocritical fraud and false promises of his
enemies."</p>

<span class="smcap">PREPARATIONS FOR INVADING FRANCE.</span></h3>


<p>It is impossible for us to revert with never so cursory a glance to
the departure of Henry of Monmouth from his native shores at the head
of an armament intended to recover his alleged rights in France,
without finding various questions suggesting themselves, both on the
mode adopted for raising and embodying the men, and for transporting
the troops and military stores, and all the accompaniments of an
invading army. The Kings of England
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page120" name="page120">(p. 120)</a></span>
had then no standing
army, nor any permanent royal fleet.</p>

<p>In the present volume we have often seen that on an emergence, such as
an irruption of the Scots, or the necessity of resisting the Welsh
more effectually, the sheriffs of different counties were commanded to
array the able-bodied men within their jurisdiction, and join the
royal standard by an appointed day; and, no doubt, many a motley, and
ill-favoured, and ill-appointed company were seen in the sheriff's
train. We have also been reminded with how great difficulty even these
musters could be collected, and kept together, and marched to the
place of rendezvous; and how seldom could they be brought in time to
join in the engagement for which they were destined. We have
repeatedly also learned that the nobles who would recommend themselves
to the royal favour, or espoused heartily the cause in which they were
engaged, headed their own retainers to the field, and made themselves
responsible for their maintenance and pay. In the present case we have
reason to believe that the army consisted mainly of volunteers; at
least, that the principal persons in rank and fortune joined the
King's standard without compulsion. A very lively and enthusiastic
interest in the success of his expedition prevailed through the whole
country; and the nobles redeemed their pledge, without grudging, that
they would aid him in their persons. The pay of the army
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page121" name="page121">(p. 121)</a></span>
was
settled beforehand, at a fixed rate, from a duke
downwards.<a id="notetag093" name="notetag093"></a><a href="#note093">[93]</a></p>

<p>Whether there is any foundation at all in fact for the tradition of
Henry's resolution to take with him no married man or widow's son, the
tradition itself bears such strong testimony to the general estimate
of Henry's character for bravery at once and kindness of heart, that
it would be unpardonable to omit every reference to it altogether. The
song of Agincourt, in which it occurs, is unquestionably of ancient
origin; probably written and sung within a very few years of the
expedition.<a id="notetag094" name="notetag094"></a><a href="#note094">[94]</a>
Internal evidence would induce us to infer that it was
composed before Henry's death, and just after his marriage with
Katharine:</p>

<p class="poem">
"The fairest flower in all France,<br>
To the rose of England I give free."
</p>

<p>The ballad, at all events, is among the earliest of our English songs,
and was delivered down from father
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page122" name="page122">(p. 122)</a></span>
to son in the most
distant parts of the kingdom, when very few of those who preserved the
national poetry from oblivion could read. This circumstance easily
accounts for the many various readings which are found in different
copies now, whilst these in their turn tend to establish the antiquity
of the song. The admirable simplicity and true natural beauty of the
verse will justify its repetition here, though it has already appeared
in our title-page, when it ascribes to Henry the combination of valour
and high resolve, with merciful considerateness and tender feeling for
others. Be the authority for this reported restriction, imposed by
Henry on those who were commissioned to recruit soldiers for his
expedition, what it may, (let it be founded in fact, or in the
imagination of the writer,) it bears that testimony to Henry's
character,<a id="notetag095" name="notetag095"></a><a href="#note095">[95]</a>
which the whole current of authentic documents tends
fully to establish. He was brave, and he was merciful.</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Go!
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="page123" name="page123">(p. 123)</a></span>
    call up Cheshire and Lancashire,<br>
And Derby hills,<a id="notetag096" name="notetag096"></a><a href="#note096">[96]</a>
which are so free;<br>
  But neither married man, nor widow's son,&mdash;<br>
  No widow's curse shall go with me."
</p>

<p>Of the numbers who went with Henry to France various accounts are
delivered down, and different calculations have been made. The song of
Agincourt raises the sum of the "right good company" to "thirty
thousand stout men and three:" and probably this total, embracing
servants and attendants of every kind, is not at all an exaggeration
of the number actually transported from England to Normandy; though,
if by "stout men" we are to understand warriors able to handle the
spear, the bow, the sword, and the battleaxe, we must not reckon them
at more than one-third of that number.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>The expedients which Henry found it necessary to adopt for the safe
transportation of this armament, compel us to review, however briefly,
the state and circumstances of English navigation at the period. The
Author has already hazarded the opinion in his Preface, that Henry of
Monmouth may with justice be regarded as the founder of the British
navy; and he feels himself called upon to refer to some facts by which
such a representation might
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page124" name="page124">(p. 124)</a></span>
seem to be countenanced. He
gladly acknowledges that the idea was first suggested to him by the
publication of Sir Henry Ellis; whilst every subsequent research, and
every additional fact, have tended to confirm and illustrate the same
view.<a id="notetag097" name="notetag097"></a><a href="#note097">[97]</a></p>

<p>Though few subjects are more interesting, or more deserve the
attention of our fellow-countrymen, yet it is confessedly beyond the
province of these Memoirs to enter at any length upon a dissertation
on the naval affairs of Great Britain. Since, however, if
satisfactorily established, the fact will recommend the hero of
Agincourt to the grateful remembrance of his father-land in a
department of national strength and glory in which few of us have
probably hitherto felt indebted to him, it is hoped that these brief
remarks may not be deemed out of place.</p>

<p>Unquestionably, many previous sovereigns of England had directed much
of their thoughts to the maritime power of the country. From the time
of Alfred himself, downwards, we may trace, at various intervals,
evident marks of the measures adopted by our Kings and the
legislature, and also by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page125" name="page125">(p. 125)</a></span>
powerful individuals and merchant
companies, to keep up a succession of sea-worthy vessels, and mariners
to man them. Two hundred years before the date of Henry's expedition,
as early as the year 1212, King John seems to have established a sort
of dry covered dock at Portsmouth for the preservation of ships and
their rigging during the winter. But the very instances to which
appeals have been made by various writers, to prove the antiquity of
the naval force of South Britain, tend by their testimony to confirm
the opinions we are here disposed to adopt. In every successive reign,
the annals of which supply any information on the subject, the
evidence is clear that the rulers of England did not contemplate the
establishment of a fleet belonging to the nation as its own property.
The tenures, moreover, by which many maritime towns held their
charters, whilst they evince the importance attached to this
department of an island's political power, coincide altogether with
the view we are taking. The obligation, for example, under which the
Cinque Ports lay of furnishing, whenever required, fifty ships, manned
each with twenty-four mariners, for fifteen days, enabled the monarch
indeed to calculate, from the fulfilment of such stipulated
engagements, on a certain supply, adequate, it may be, to meet the
usual demand; but at the same time it implied that he had no fleet of
his own on which he could rely. Whilst the limited extent to which
ships could be supplied by the most rigid exaction of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page126" name="page126">(p. 126)</a></span>
the
terms of those tenures compelled the state, on any occasion when
extraordinary efforts were requisite, to depend upon the varying and
precarious supply produced by the system of
impressment.<a id="notetag098" name="notetag098"></a><a href="#note098">[98]</a></p>

<p>When Henry ascended the throne, he found still in full operation this
old system of our maritime proceedings. Whenever, as we have seen, an
occasion required the transport of a considerable body of men from our
havens, or forces to be embarked for the protection of our shores and
of our merchants, in addition to the contingent, which could be
exacted from various chartered towns, the King's government was
obliged either to hire ships from foreign countries, or to lay
forcible hands by way of impressment on the vessels of his own
subjects. A few instances, more or less closely connected with the
immediate subject of our present inquiry, will serve to illustrate
that point.</p>

<p>When, for example, Henry's great grandfather Edward III. was preparing
for the expedition, which he headed in person, intended to relieve
Rochelle, his grandfather John of Gaunt, February 10, 1372, as we find
by the records of the Duchy of Lancaster, commanded all his stewards
in Wales to assist Walter de Wodeburgh, serjeant-at-arms, appointed by
the King to arrest all ships of twenty tons' burden [and upwards?] for
the passage of the King
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page127" name="page127">(p. 127)</a></span>
and his army to France, and to take
sufficient security that they be all ready by the 1st of May either at
Southampton, Portsmouth, Hamel in the Rys, or Hamel Stoke.</p>

<p>The records of the Privy Council (11 December, probably 1405,) supply
us with an instance (one out of many) which shows, at the same time,
the great injury which the public service sustained by this system,
and the ruinous consequences which it was calculated to entail on the
merchants and the owners of ships. Henry IV. had intended to proceed
in person to Guienne; and for that purpose, with the advice of his
council, had impressed all the ships westward. His voyage was
deferred; but the ships were still, as they had been for a long time,
under arrest. The masters had sent a deputation to him to implore some
compensation for their great
expenses,<a id="notetag099" name="notetag099"></a><a href="#note099">[99]</a>
and some means of support.
Henry then wrote to the council, praying them [vous prions] to provide
some help for these poor men; and to assure them that no long time
would elapse before their services would be called for, since either
himself or his representative would undertake the voyage. In the same
letter he prayed the council also to write under his privy seal to the
King of Portugal, to beg of him a supply of galleys, sufficient to
enable him to resist the malice of his enemies the French, and to
protect his land and his realm.</p>

<p>We <span class="pagenum"><a id="page128" name="page128">(p. 128)</a></span>
must not suppose that the French monarch found himself
under more favourable circumstances when he would prepare for any
important affair on the sea. The same system of impressment and hiring
was necessarily adopted in France. Thus we find, in 1417, when the
French government resolved to make a powerful effort to crush the navy
of England, the ships were first to be "hired, at a great sum of gold,
from the state of Genoa." These mercenary vessels formed the fleet
over which the Earl of Huntingdon gained a decided victory immediately
before Henry's second expedition to France.</p>

<p>Thus, too, (not to cite any more examples,) no sooner had Henry
determined to assert his rights on the Continent, and to enforce them
by the sword, than he despatched ambassadors to Zealand and Holland to
negociate with the Duke of Holland for a supply of ships; doubtless
assured that all which he could impress or hire in all his ports would
not be sufficient for the safe transport of his troops, and "their
furniture of war." But Henry's ardent and commanding mind soon saw how
powerful an engine, both of defence and of conquest, would be found in
a permanent royal navy, and how indispensable such an establishment
was to any insular sovereign who desired to provide for his country
the means of offering a bold front against aggression, protecting
herself from insult, maintaining her rights, and taking a lead among
the surrounding powers. He resolved, therefore, not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page129" name="page129">(p. 129)</a></span> to
depend upon the precarious and unsatisfactory expedients either of
hiring vessels, which would never be his own, (in a market, too, where
his enemy might forestal him, and where his necessities would enhance
the price,) or of compelling his merchants to leave their trading, and
minister to the emergence of the state, at their own inevitable loss,
and not improbable ruin. His immediate determination was to spare
neither labour nor expense in providing a navy of his own, such as
would be ever ready at the sovereign's command to protect the coast,
to sweep the seas of those hordes of pirates which then infested them,
and to bear his forces with safety and credit to any distant shores.
He thus thought he should best secure his own ports and provinces from
foreign invasion; afford a safeguard to his own merchants, and to
those traders who would traffic with his people; and generally make
England a more formidable antagonist and a more respected neighbour.</p>

<p>This new line of policy he adopted very early in his reign. Whilst he
was at Southampton, (at the date of this digression, on his first
expedition to Normandy,) we find him superintending the building of
various large ships: and, two years afterwards, when news reached him
of the victory gained by his brother the Duke of Bedford over the
French fleet off Harfleur, the tidings found him making the most
effectual means for securing future victories; he was at Smalhithe in
Kent, personally superintending
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page130" name="page130">(p. 130)</a></span>
the building of some ships
to add to his own royal navy, then only in its
infancy.<a id="notetag100" name="notetag100"></a><a href="#note100">[100]</a></p>

<p>Nor did he confine his labours in this great work to England; he
employed also his Continental resources in forwarding the same object.
A letter from one John Alcestre, from
Bayonne,<a id="notetag101" name="notetag101"></a><a href="#note101">[101]</a>
informs us of a
ship of very considerable dimensions then on the stocks at that port,
for the building of which the mayor and "his consorts" had contracted
with Henry. The vessel was one hundred and eighty-six feet in length
from "the onmost end of the stem onto the post behind." "The stem" was
in height ninety-six feet, and the keel was in length one hundred and
twelve feet.</p>

<p>Henry appears also to have acquired the reputation in foreign
countries of having a desire to possess large vessels of his own. An
agent in Spain, for example, after informing one of the King's
officers in England of his unsuccessful endeavour to cause to be
seized for the King's use four armed galleys of Provence, expected to
enter the port of Valencia, and which the King of Arragon's government
had consented to arrest for Henry,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page131" name="page131">(p. 131)</a></span>
but which disappointed
them by not coming to land, mentions that two new carraks (a species
of large transport vessel) were in building "at Bartholem," which the
King might have if he pleased.</p>

<p>The high importance which Henry attached to these rising bulwarks of
his country shows itself in various ways; in none more curious and
striking than (a fact, it is presumed, new to history,) in the solemn
religious ceremony with which they were consecrated before he
committed them to the mighty waters. One of the highest order of the
Christian ministry was employed, and similar devotions were performed
at the dedication of one of the royal "great ships," as we should find
in the consecration of a cathedral. They were called also by some of
the holiest of all names ever uttered by
Christians.<a id="notetag102" name="notetag102"></a><a href="#note102">[102]</a>
Thus, on the
completion of the good ship the Grace-Dieu at Southampton, the
"venerable father in Christ, the Bishop of
Bangor,"<a id="notetag103" name="notetag103"></a><a href="#note103">[103]</a> was
commissioned by the King's council to proceed from London at the
public expense to consecrate it.</p>

<p>When Henry of Monmouth died, the navy of England was doubtless yet in
its
infancy;<a id="notetag104" name="notetag104"></a><a href="#note104">[104]</a>
but it owed its
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page132" name="page132">(p. 132)</a></span>
existence as a permanent
royal establishment to him. We cannot look back on that "day of small
things" without feelings of admiration and gratitude; nor now that we
seem, for a time at least, free from the danger of foreign invasion,
must we forget that, in the late tremendous struggle which swept away
the monarchies and the liberties of Europe in one resistless flood, to
our navy, which had grown with the growth of our country, and
strengthened with her strength, our native land may, under the
blessing of Heaven, have been indebted for its continuance in freedom
and independence. Of those wooden walls of Old England, as a royal
establishment based on systematic principles, Henry of Monmouth was
undoubtedly the founder.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>Whilst Henry was engaged at Southampton in personally superintending
the preparations for invading France, an event occurred well fitted to
fill him equally with surprise, and indignation, and sorrow. A
conspiracy against his crown and his life was brought to light, which
had been formed by three in his company against whom he could have
entertained no suspicions: Richard of York, whom he had created Earl
of Cambridge; Henry Lord Scrope, the treasurer; and Sir Thomas Grey of
Heton. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page133" name="page133">(p. 133)</a></span>
The Rolls of Parliament, containing the authentic
record of the proceedings consequent upon the discovery, and the
original letters of the Earl of Cambridge, leave no question as to the
designs of the conspirators. Some doubts may exist as to their
motives: whether they were influenced singly by a generous resolution
to restore the crown to its alleged rightful
heir,<a id="notetag105" name="notetag105"></a><a href="#note105">[105]</a>
or by some
less honourable and more selfish
feeling;<a id="notetag106" name="notetag106"></a><a href="#note106">[106]</a>
whether by any offence
taken against Henry, or, as it is alleged, by the vast bribe offered
to them by the crown of France; or whether by more than one of these
motives combined, must remain a matter of conjecture. We cannot,
perhaps, be certified of the means by which Henry became acquainted
with the plot, nor if, as we are told, he was informed of it by the
Earl of March himself, can we ascertain beyond doubt how large or how
small a share that nobleman had in the previous deliberations and
resolutions of the conspirators.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page134" name="page134">(p. 134)</a></span>
Whether he first consented
to their design of setting him up as king, and then repented of so
ungrateful an act towards one who had behaved to him with so much
kindness and confidence, or whether he instantly took the resolve to
nip this treason in the bud, no documents enable us to decide. If the
Earl of Cambridge's confession be the truth, the Earl of March at one
time was himself consenting to the plot.</p>

<p>On the 21st of July a commission was appointed, consisting of the
Earl Marshal, two of the
judges,<a id="notetag107" name="notetag107"></a><a href="#note107">[107]</a>
six lords, and Sir Thomas
Erpingham, to try the conspirators: and the sheriff of the county was
ordered to summon a jury, who assembled at Southampton on the 2nd of
August, and found as their verdict, that, on the 20th of July, the
Earl of Cambridge and Sir Thomas Grey had traitorously conspired to
collect a body of armed men, to conduct Edmund
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page135" name="page135">(p. 135)</a></span>
Earl of March
to the frontiers of Wales, and to proclaim him the rightful heir to
the crown, in case Richard II. were actually dead, against the
pretensions of the King, whom they intended to style "the Usurper of
England;" that they purposed to destroy the King and his brothers,
with other nobles of the land; and that Lord Scrope consented to the
said treasonable designs, and concealed them from the King.</p>

<p>Lord Scrope denied having consented to the death of the King, or
having had any communication with the other conspirators on that
point; and he declared that he had communicated with them on the other
points solely to possess himself of a knowledge of their designs in
order to frustrate them. He then pleaded his peerage, and his right to
be tried by his peers.</p>

<p>Sentence of death in the usual manner was passed upon Grey; but the
King having, by a most rare instance of mercy in those days, remitted
that part of the sentence which directed him to be drawn on a hurdle
and hung, he was allowed to walk through the town to the Northgate,
and was there immediately beheaded. On Monday, August 5, the Duke of
Clarence presided in a court of the peers, who, having satisfied
themselves by carefully examining the record of the conviction of the
prisoners, Scrope and Cambridge, adjudged them to death. They were
both executed within a few hours of this judgment. The head of Scrope
was ordered
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page136" name="page136">(p. 136)</a></span>
to be affixed on one of the gates of York and
the head of Grey to be stuck up at Newcastle upon Tyne, to mark the
baseness of their ingratitude, who had enjoyed so closely the
confidence and friendship of
Henry.<a id="notetag108" name="notetag108"></a><a href="#note108">[108]</a></p>

<p>Nothing is recorded officially of any bribe from France, but the fact
of "one million of gold" having been promised as the wages of their
treason is asserted by historians. "These lords, for lucre of money,"
(to use the words of a
manuscript<a id="notetag109" name="notetag109"></a><a href="#note109">[109]</a>
apparently contemporary with
the event,) "had made promise to the Frenchmen to have slayne King
Henry and all his worthy brethren by a false trayne [treason?]
suddenly or they had beware. But Almighty God, of his great grace,
held his holy hand over them, and saved them from this perilous meyne
[band]. And for to have done this they received of the Frenchmen a
million of gold, and that was there proved openly."</p>

<p>As to the guilt or innocence of the Earl of March himself, no proof
can be drawn from the fact of his having obtained a full and free
pardon<a id="notetag110" name="notetag110"></a><a href="#note110">[110]</a>
a few days after the event. "Such pardons" (as Dr. Lingard
rightly observes) "were frequently solicited by the innocent as a
measure of precaution to defeat
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page137" name="page137">(p. 137)</a></span>
the malice and prevent the
accusations of their enemies." Sir Harris Nicolas indeed suggests,
"that it would be difficult to show an instance in which they were
granted in favour of a person who was not strongly suspected, or who
had not purchased them at the expense of his accomplices." But it
requires little more than a cursory glance at our authentic records to
be assured that Dr. Lingard's view is the more correct. Take, for
example, the pardon granted in 1412 to the Archbishop of Canterbury,
and couched in almost the same words. There is indeed in this pardon a
clause very different from the pardon of the Earl of March; but it is
a difference which only tends to establish this point, that the
pardons in many cases were <i>formal</i>, and altogether independent of the
guilt or innocence of the party. The Archbishop (Arundel) is pardoned
for all treasons, felonies, and so forth, excepting some outrageous
crimes of which he was never suspected; and also provided he was not
then lying in prison as a felon convict, or as an adherent to Owyn
Glyndowr. Many such instances
occur.<a id="notetag111" name="notetag111"></a><a href="#note111">[111]</a></p>

<p>On this sad subject two original letters are preserved, addressed to
Henry by the Earl of Cambridge; they are found among the "Original
Letters" published
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page138" name="page138">(p. 138)</a></span>
by Sir Henry Ellis, accompanied, as is
usual<a id="notetag112" name="notetag112"></a><a href="#note112">[112]</a>
in his valuable collection, by a succinct and clear
statement of such facts as may be necessary for their elucidation. The
first contains the Earl's confession; whether written before or after
his trial, is not evident. The second sues for mercy, probably after
the jury had returned their verdict; it may be even after the sentence
was passed by the peers, though a very short portion of a day elapsed
between that sentence and his execution.</p>

<p>It is curious to learn, from the first of these letters, that even
down to the year of Henry's first expedition to France, the people
were from time to time deluded by rumours that Richard II. was still
alive. The Earl of Cambridge acknowledged that the conspirators
intended to set up the Earl of March, "taking upon him the sovereignty
of this land, if yonder man's person, which they call King Richard,
had not been alive, as I wot well that he is not alive." He confessed,
also, a guilty knowledge of a conspiracy to "bring in that person
which they named King Richard, and Harry Percy out of Scotland, with a
power of Scots."</p>

<p>Another very curious fact is alleged in this document, interesting in
more points than one. It shows
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page139" name="page139">(p. 139)</a></span>
what a powerful engine in
those days was the <i>Confessional</i>; and it proves also that, though
Henry has been called the King of Priests, there were some of the
sacred order in high station who were bent on his overthrow. Cambridge
declares that both the Earl of March and his man Lusy had assured him
that the Earl "was not shriven of a great while [had not attended the
priests for the purposes of confession] without his confessors, on

him, by way of penance, this condition, that he should claim his right
to the crown.</p>

<p>My most dreadful and sovereign liege Lord, like to your Highness

     all worldly things; and by the accord of Lord Scrope and Sir
     Thomas Grey, to have had the aforesaid Earl in the land of Wales
     without your licence, taking upon him the sovereignty of this
     land, if yonder man's person, which they call King Richard, had

which point I put me wholly in your grace. And as for the
     form of a proclamation which should have been cried in the Earl's
     name as the heir to the crown of England against you, my liege
     Lord, called by untrue name Harry of Lancaster, usurper of
     England, to the intent to have made the more people to have drawn
     to him and from you; of the which cry Scrope knew not of as from
     me, but Grey did; having with the Earl a banner of the arms of
     England, having also the crown of Spain on a pallet, which, my
     liege Lord, is one of your weddys, for the which offence I put me
     wholly in your grace. And as for the purpose taken by Umfrevyle
     and Wederyngtoun for the bringing in of that person which they
     named King Richard, and Herry Percy, out of Scotland, with a
     power of Scots, and their power together seeming to them able to
     give you a battle, of the which intent Sir Thomas Grey wist of,
     but not Scrope as by me; of the which knowing I submit me wholly
     into your grace. And as for the taking of your castles in Wales,
     Davy Howell made me be host, so there were a stirring in the
     North; of the which point I put me wholly in your grace. And as
     touching the Earl of March and Lusy his man, they said me both,
     that the Earl was not shriven of a great while, but at all his
     confessors put

<p>Henry having taken every precaution for the preservation of his people
at home, as well against foreign designs as against disturbers of the
peace within the realm, left Porchester Castle on the 7th of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page142" name="page142">(p. 142)</a></span>
August, with the intention of superintending in person the embarkation
of his troops. This seems to have occupied him to the 10th, when he
went on board the "Royal Trinity," and immediately gave signal for the
ships to join him from the different stations in which they were
awaiting his command. The fleet consisted of about thirteen hundred
vessels of very different sizes, varying from twenty to three hundred
tons' burden. Probably, reckoning servants, attendants of every kind,
as well as fighting men, this fleet transported to the shores of
France not less than thirty thousand persons. Of these there were only
about two thousand five hundred men-at-arms, four thousand
horse-archers, four thousand foot-archers, and one thousand gunners,
miners, masons, smiths, with others. The whole amount of fighting men,
according to this calculation, does not exceed eleven thousand five
hundred. The expedition sailed with a favourable wind on Sunday,
August 11,
1415.<a id="notetag114" name="notetag114"></a><a href="#note114">[114]</a></p>

<p>Every document, probably, now known relative to this expedition, has
been examined by Sir Harris Nicolas; and to his able digest of the
facts relating to this part of Henry's proceedings the reader is
referred for the more minute details.</p>

1415.</h3>


<p>From this time Henry's is the life rather of a general than of a King.
His successive battles, and sieges, and victories throw but
occasionally more or new light on his character; and it is not within
the limits of these Memoirs to describe his military achievements, or
to enter upon a detailed examination of his campaigns, except so far
only as the events elucidate his character, or as a knowledge of them
may be necessary for a fuller acquaintance with his life. Many
circumstances of this kind occur between the day when he quitted his
port of Southampton, and the hour which terminated his brief but
eventful career on earth. The enemies of his fair fame cite some one
or other of those transactions to prove him a mass of ambition,
superstition, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page144" name="page144">(p. 144)</a></span>
cruelty. It will be the reader's part to
decide for himself whether the facts in evidence bear out those
charges, or whether a more equitable judgment would not rather
pronounce him to be a man who, in the midst of a most exciting and
distracting career, never forgot the principles of piety, justice, and
mercy. To attest his valour we need summon no evidence; though even in
that point, which the universal voice of Europe had pronounced to be
unassailable, his challenge to the Dauphin has been cited by one
author as an act that must tarnish his character. The justness of the
reflection we shall weigh hereafter. Of licentiousness after his
accession to the throne his enemies themselves have never ventured to
whisper a suspicion.</p>

<p>As Henry's fleet was leaving his native shores, two incidents are said
to have occurred of opposite omen, such as in those days of
superstition were wont to exercise powerful influence over the minds
of men far removed from the lowest ranks of the people. Swans were
seen swimming gaily and fearlessly around the ships, as if hailing
them on their own watery element; and their appearance was noted as a
happy and encouraging auspice. On the other hand, a fire broke out in
one of the large ships before Henry sailed, which did considerable
damage among the vessels, not without loss of many lives; and this was
deemed an omen of such dire portent, that many of the King's followers
would have dissuaded him from persevering in his expedition.</p>

<p>Henry's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page145" name="page145">(p. 145)</a></span>
was a pious, but not a religiously timid or
superstitious mind; and, unaffected by this incident, or the
entreaties of his friends, he proceeded on his voyage forthwith, and
on Friday, August 13, at five o'clock in the afternoon, he entered the
mouth of the Seine, and anchored at a place called Clef de
Caus,<a id="notetag115" name="notetag115"></a><a href="#note115">[115]</a>
between Honfleur and Harfleur, three miles from the latter town. He
landed his forces without opposition; and, on coming on shore himself,
he knelt down, and prayed to Almighty God to prosper his just
cause.<a id="notetag116" name="notetag116"></a><a href="#note116">[116]</a></p>

<p>Henry resolved on laying siege to Harfleur, the inhabitants of which
seemed equally determined to resist him. The siege of Harfleur, which
commenced on Sunday, August 18, is described with great minuteness by
several writers. His brother, the Duke of Clarence, appears to have
held the most prominent place among Henry's officers; and much praise
is ascribed to him for his prowess and military talent. Every mode of
attack and defence then reckoned among martial tactics was carried out
on both sides.</p>

<p>In addition, however, to the wonted privations and hardships of a
protracted siege, the English host
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page146" name="page146">(p. 146)</a></span>
was visited by a violent
disease, which spread rapidly through every grade of the army,
unsparingly thinning its ranks and carrying off its officers, and
threatening annihilation to the whole body. Whilst this calamity was
raging at its height, and making dreadful havoc among the soldiery, an
incident is recorded to have taken place, to which the mind gladly
turns from the din and turmoil of the siege, and the devastations of
that fatal scourge; and though the scene is itself the chamber of
death, we cannot but feel a melancholy satisfaction in contemplating
it for a while. An ecclesiastic, who was present in the camp, and in
attendance on his royal master, records the anecdote in the most
casual
manner,<a id="notetag117" name="notetag117"></a><a href="#note117">[117]</a>
without a word of admiration or remark to call our
attention to it, as though he were relating a circumstance of no
unusual occurrence, and such merely as those who knew his master might
hear of without surprise; whilst few pages of history bear to any
monarch more beautiful and affecting evidence of habitual kindness of
heart, pure sympathy with a suffering fellow-creature, and devoted
fulfilment of the dearest offices of friendship. Whilst Richard
Courtenay, Bishop of Norwich, one of the victims of the dysentery, was
lingering in the agonies of death, we find Henry in the midst of his
besieging army, at the height of a very severe struggle, war and
disease raging on every side,&mdash;not in a council of his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page147" name="page147">(p. 147)</a></span>
officers, planning the operations of to-morrow,&mdash;nor on his couch,
giving his body and mind repose from the fatigues and excitement of
his opening campaign,&mdash;but we see him on his knees at the death-bed of
a dying minister of religion, joining in the offices of the church so
long as the waning spirit could partake of its consolations; and then
not commissioning others, however faithful representatives they might
have been, to act in his stead, but by his own hands soothing the
sufferings of the dying prelate, and striving to make the struggle of
his latter moments less bitter. Had Henry visited the tent of the good
Bishop when he first knew of his malady, and charged any of his
numerous retinue to pay especial attention to his wants and comforts,
it would have been regarded, at such an hour of pressing emergence, as
an act worthy of a Christian King. But Henry, who in no department of
his public duties ever willingly deputed to others what he could
personally attend to himself, carried the same principle into the
exercise of the charities of private life; and has here left a pattern
of Christian sympathy and lowliness of mind, of genuine philanthropy,
and the sincere affection of true friendship, worthy of prince and
peasant alike to imitate. Bishop Courtenay is said to have been among
Henry's chosen friends, recommended to him by the singular qualities
of his head and his heart. He was a person (we are told) endowed with
intellectual and moral excellences of a very high character;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page148" name="page148">(p. 148)</a></span>
and Henry knew how to appreciate the value, and cultivate the
friendship, of such a man. Having enjoyed the satisfaction and benefit
of his society in life, now, when he was on the point of quitting this
world for ever, Henry never withdrew from his bed; but, watching him
with tender anxiety till the ministers of religion had solemnized the
last rite according to the prevailing practice of the church in those
days, even then, "in his own person," he continued to supply the wants
of sinking mortality, "with his own
hands<a id="notetag118" name="notetag118"></a><a href="#note118">[118]</a>
wiping the chilled
feet" of his dying friend. The manuscript proceeds to say, that, when
life was extinct, with pious regard for his memory, Henry caused his
body to be conveyed to England, and to be honourably buried among the
royal corpses in Westminster.</p>

<p>Three days after this prelate's death, on Wednesday, September 18th,
an agreement to surrender on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page149" name="page149">(p. 149)</a></span>
the following Sunday was entered
into; the inhabitants of the town pledging themselves by a most solemn
oath to abide by the terms of the agreement. The ceremony on this
occasion must have had a very imposing effect. The King's chaplain,
Benedict Bishop of Bangor, in his pontifical dress, carried the
consecrated Host to the walls of the town, preceded by thirty-two
chaplains, each in full canonicals, and attended by as many esquires,
one of whom bore a lighted taper before each priest. As soon as the
parties were sworn on the elements, the townsmen were assured that
they need fear no acts of wrong or violence, for the King wished
rather to preserve than to destroy his own territory.</p>

<p>On Sunday, September 22, the town was surrendered with much solemn
state into Henry's hands. At the appointed hour, Henry, being dressed
in the robes of royalty, ascended a throne erected under a silk
pavilion on the top of the hill opposite to the town. All his peers
and great men were assembled around him. "Our
King"<a id="notetag119" name="notetag119"></a><a href="#note119">[119]</a>
(says a
writer who was probably an eye-witness) "sat in his estate as royal as
did ever any King; and, as it is said, there never was a Christian
King so royal, neither so lordly, sat in his seat as did he." From
this seat to the town a passage was formed by the English soldiers,
through which the late governor, Sir Lionel Braquemont, the Lord de
Gaucourt, and others, with the Host borne before them, attended by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page150" name="page150">(p. 150)</a></span>
those who had sworn to observe the treaty, and by thirty-four
of the chief inhabitants, passed to Henry's presence, "who forgave
them their injustice in keeping his own town from him; and, having
hospitably entertained them, dismissed them courteously." Thus fell
into Henry's hand one of the most important towns of Normandy, after a
siege of about thirty-six days, during which the zeal and valour of
the assailants and the besieged were equally
displayed.<a id="notetag120" name="notetag120"></a><a href="#note120">[120]</a></p>

<p>On the following day Henry entered the town, dismounting at the gate,
and walking barefoot to St. Martin's church, in which he gave solemn
thanks to God for his success. He then commanded all the women and
children, and the disabled, to be separated from those who had sworn
allegiance to him, as well as from those who, having refused that
oath, were regarded as prisoners. The persons thus separated were next
day sent out of the town, to the number of nearly two thousand, loudly
lamenting their fate. They were escorted by the English; and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page151" name="page151">(p. 151)</a></span>
all persons belonging to the church, and the women and children, had a
present of five sous for their journey, and were permitted to dress
themselves in their best apparel, and carry each a moderate bundle
with them. It was forbidden to search the priests, and also the heads
or the bosoms of the women. At St. Aubon, about four miles from
Harfleur, they were entreated to refresh themselves with bread and
cheese and wine; at Lislebone the Marshal Boucicault received them,
and they were forwarded by water to Rouen. At Henry's invitation, many
tradesmen and others came over from England, and became inhabitants of
Harfleur; the King, with the desire of strengthening the place, having
guaranteed, by a proclamation through England, a house of inheritance
to all who would settle there.</p>

<p>About this time Henry sent a message to the Dauphin, challenging him
to single combat, and so to decide the dreadful struggle in which the
two kingdoms were engaged, without the further effusion of blood.
Occasion has been taken to reflect on this act of Henry's, as a stain
both on his personal valour and on his principles of justice: the
first, because he was twenty-seven years old, and the Dauphin not
twenty; the latter, because it were unjust "to expect that so
important a stake should be hazarded on the result of such a meeting."
To enhance Henry's guilt of cowardice, we are told that he challenged
"a mere youth, of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page152" name="page152">(p. 152)</a></span>
whose prowess or bodily strength there is
not the slightest evidence, and who died <i>in the December following</i>."
This is not the first time we have had occasion to remark on this same
writer's injustice towards Henry's memory. Why mention the Dauphin's
death in the following December, except to insinuate that Henry <i>knew</i>
he was then in a weak state of bodily health? Of this, however, there
is not the shadow of reason for suspecting Henry. On the contrary, the
evidence tends to the directly opposite conclusion. The Dauphin died
on the 25th December following; but so sudden was his decease, that a
suspicion was excited of his having been poisoned. He had for a long
time been actively engaged in heading one of the contending parties in
France, and he is reported to have been a bold and presumptuous
prince.<a id="notetag121" name="notetag121"></a><a href="#note121">[121]</a>
And, even a month after the battle of Agincourt, we find
him, apparently in full strength both of body and mind, exercising the
authority of the King, his father, in Paris; vigorously and
effectually resisting the entrance of the Duke of Burgundy, who
marched with his army direct to the gates of that city, determined to
force for himself an entrance into it. And, on his father's relapsing
into his malady, he vigorously seized the government, setting the Duke
of Orleans at defiance, and carrying off the King, his father, ill as
he was, to the siege of
Arras.<a id="notetag122" name="notetag122"></a><a href="#note122">[122]</a>
Whether the difference of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page153" name="page153">(p. 153)</a></span>
age between these two young warriors is so great as to justify
such strong reflections on Henry's courage, must be left to the
judgment of impartial minds. But, when the Dauphin is called a mere
youth, it must be borne in mind that he was considerably older than
Henry was when he headed his father's troops in Wales, or fought so
gallantly in the field of Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>But we must not let this charge, affecting Henry's valour and justice,
be dismissed without observing that not only did Henry believe, but it
was the universal belief of the age, that "trial by battle" was a
proper way of ending a dispute, and one acceptable to God: one in
which the justice of the quarrel decided, more than the strength or
skill of the combatants. We have proved that there could have been no
grounds for Henry's supposing that he was sending a challenge to a
youth enervated by sickness; and the difference of age alleged now, at
length, in disparagement of Henry's valour, would have been scouted by
all the good knights of Christendom, had it been pleaded as an apology
for the Dauphin declining the challenge. Surely it indicates a
conviction that the points in which the character of a man, famed for
bravery and justice, is assailable, are few and unimportant, when such
frivolous attacks as this are made on his fair fame.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Henry's challenge to the Dauphin</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page154" name="page154">(p. 154)</a></span>
 may be thus translated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="letter">
<p>
     Henry, by the grace of God, King of France and England, Lord of
     Ireland, to the high and mighty Prince, the Dauphin of Vienne,
     our cousin, eldest son of the most mighty Prince, our cousin and
     adversary of France. Whereas, from reverence to God, and to avoid
     the shedding of human blood, we have many times and in many ways
     followed and sought for peace, and have not been able to possess
     it, yet our desire to secure it increases more and more; and well
     considering that our wars are followed by the death of men, the
     destruction of countries, the wailings of women and children, and
     so many evils generally as every good Christian must lament and
     pity, especially ourselves, whom this affair most affects, as it
     does, to take all pains and diligence to find every means within
     our knowledge to avoid the above-mentioned evils and distresses,
     and to acquire the grace of God and the praise of the world. And,
     since we have thought and advised, it has seemed to us,
     considering it has pleased God to visit our cousin with
     infirmity, that the remedy rests upon us and you. And to the end
     that every one might know that we withdraw not ourselves from it,
     nor from our part in it, we offer you to put our whole quarrel,
     with God's grace, between our person and yours. And if it should
     seem to you that you cannot agree to this, because of the
     interest which you conceive our cousin, your father, has in it,
     we declare to you in this our intention, that if you will
     entertain it, and engage in it, we are well pleased that our said
     cousin, for our reverence to God, and because he is a sacred
     person, shall have and enjoy all he has at present for the term
     of his life, whatever shall happen by the will of God between us
     and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page155" name="page155">(p. 155)</a></span>
you, as it shall be agreed between his council,
     ours, and yours.</p>

<p>So that if God shall give us the victory, the crown of France
     with its appurtenances, as our right, shall be immediately
     rendered to us without difficulty after his decease. And to this
     all the lords and estates of France shall be bound, as it shall
     be agreed between us.</p>

<p>For it is better for us, cousin, thus to decide this war for ever
     between our two persons, than to suffer the misbelievers, by
     occasion of our wars, to destroy Christianity, our holy mother
     the church to remain in divisions, and the people of God to
     destroy one another. We pray much that you may have as strong a
     desire to avoid that, and to come to peace, and seek all means of
     finding it. And let us trust in God that no better way than this
     can be found. And, therefore, in discharge of our soul, and in
     charge of yours, if such great evils follow, we make to you the
     above offer.</p>

<p>Protesting ever that we make this offer for the honour and fear
     of God, and for the above causes, of our own motion, without our
     royal relations, councillors, and subjects daring in so high a
     matter to advise us. Nor can it at any time to come be urged to
     our prejudice, nor in prejudice of our good right and title which
     we have at present to the said crown with its appurtenances, nor
     to the good right and title which we now have to other our lands
     and heritages on this side the sea, nor to our heirs and
     successors, if this our offer does not take full effect between
     us and you in the manner aforesaid. Given under our privy seal,
     at our town of Harfleur, the

1415.</h3>


<p>Immediately after the surrender of Harfleur, Henry held a council to
deliberate on his future measures. All agreed that, as winter was fast
approaching, the King and his army should return to England; but there
arose a difference of opinion as to the manner of their return. Henry
entertained an insuperable objection against returning by sea; and,
notwithstanding all the dangers to which he must inevitably be
exposed, he resolved to march through Normandy to his town of Calais.
He wished to see with his own eyes, he said, the territories which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page157" name="page157">(p. 157)</a></span>
were by right his own; adding, that he put full trust in God,
in whose name he had engaged in this, as he certainly deemed it, his
righteous cause. His army had been frightfully diminished by the
dysentery; he was compelled to leave a portion of the remainder to
garrison Harfleur; and, after the most impartial consideration, the
number of fighting men with whom he could enter upon his perilous
journey cannot be supposed to have exceeded 9000, whilst the strong
probability is that the army consisted of little more than 6000. What
portion of admiration for bravery, and what of blame for rashness, an
unprejudiced mind would mingle together, when endeavouring to assign
the just reward to Henry for his decision to make his way through the
very heart of his enemy's country, himself so weak in resources, his
enemy both so strong already, and gathering in overwhelming numbers
from every side, is a problem of no easy solution. Probably we are
very scantily provided with a knowledge of all his motives; and our
praise or our censure might now be very different from what it would
be, were we acquainted with all the circumstances of the case. How far
he expected that the dissensions among the French would prevent them
from uniting to offer him any formidable opposition, though not easy
to answer, is a question not to be neglected. Especially might he have
been influenced by the expectation that the French would not withdraw
their forces from the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page158" name="page158">(p. 158)</a></span>
interior, from fear of the Duke of
Burgundy, who was ever on the watch to seize a favourable moment of
attack. The fact is beyond doubt, that, having garrisoned Harfleur, he
quitted that town about the 8th of October; leaving there all the
heavy articles and carriages, with whatever would be an impediment to
his progress, and conveying all the baggage of the army on horseback.
Henry issued a proclamation, forbidding his soldiers, on pain of
death, to be guilty of any kind of injustice or cruelty towards the
inhabitants as they passed along.</p>

<p>The King of France had collected an army from all sides: he had more
than 14,000 men-at-arms under valiant generals, with the greater part
of whom he remained at Rouen, watching the motions of the English. On
the 20th of October it was resolved in his council, by a large
majority, that the English should be resisted in a regular and pitched
battle. The King had received the celebrated standard, the Oriflamme,
with much solemnity: and war had been declared by unfurling that
consecrated ensign. There seemed at length to have spread through King
and princes, and nobles and people alike, an enthusiastic spirit,
determined to crush the invaders. The Dauphin himself could scarcely
be prevailed upon to obey his father's injunctions, and to abstain
from joining the army; his life being considered too precious to be
exposed to such danger.</p>

<p>Henry <span class="pagenum"><a id="page159" name="page159">(p. 159)</a></span>
meanwhile, after leaving
Harfleur,<a id="notetag124" name="notetag124"></a><a href="#note124">[124]</a>
proceeded
without any important interruption through Montevilliers, Fecamp,
Arques, a town about four miles inland from Dieppe; and on Saturday,
October 12, he passed about half a mile to the right of the town of
Eu, where part of the French troops were quartered. These sallied out
on the English in great numbers, and very fiercely, but were soon
repulsed; and a treaty was agreed upon between Henry and the
inhabitants, who supplied refreshments to his army. He was now
informed that the French would offer him battle in a day or two,
whilst he was passing the river Somme. Undaunted by these tidings, he
resolved to advance; and to cross that river at Blanchetache, the very
spot at which Edward III. had passed it before the battle of Cressy.
The field of Cressy was only ten English miles in advance; and it may
be safely inferred that the remembrance of the struggle and victory of
that day filled both Henry himself and his men with additional zeal
and resolution. By the false assurance of a
prisoner,<a id="notetag125" name="notetag125"></a><a href="#note125">[125]</a>
that the
passage there was defended by many noblemen with a strong force, Henry
was induced to change his route, and to proceed up the Somme on its
left bank. He reached Abbeville
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page160" name="page160">(p. 160)</a></span>
on Sunday the 13th of
October; but, to his sad disappointment, he found all the bridges
broken down, and the enemy stationed on the opposite bank to resist
his passage. At this time Henry's situation was most perilous and
dispiriting. His provisions were nearly exhausted,&mdash;the enemy had laid
waste their own country to deprive his army of all sustenance; and no
prospect was before them but famine at once, and annihilation from the
overwhelming forces of the French. His army proceeded next day, and
passed within a league of Amiens, and were much refreshed with plenty
of provisions; wine was found in such abundance that the King was
obliged to issue a proclamation prohibiting excess. On the Thursday
they reached a plain near Corbie, from which town the French made a
sally against them, but were repulsed after a brief but spirited
engagement. Here John Bromley gallantly recovered the standard of
Guienne, and for his valour was allowed to bear its figure for his
crest. Here too Henry showed that, amidst all his perils and
hardships, he was resolved to maintain the discipline of his army by
inflicting the punishment denounced by his proclamation against
violence or sacrilege. One of the soldiers was detected with a
copper-gilt pix in his
sleeve,<a id="notetag126" name="notetag126"></a><a href="#note126">[126]</a>
which he had stolen from a
neighbouring church. Henry sentenced him forthwith to be hung, as a
warning to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page161" name="page161">(p. 161)</a></span>
all others not to offend with the hope of
impunity.</p>

<p>Quitting Corbie, they passed close to Nesle on the 18th October; when
Henry, on the point of laying waste that district, heard that a
passage over the Somme was at length discovered. The French,
meanwhile, had contented themselves with proceeding before him, and
guarding the passages of the river. Whether the policy of allowing the
English to exhaust their strength of body and mind be sufficient, or
not, to account for their conduct, we have not evidence enough to
pronounce decidedly; but, on many occasions, their abstinence from
striking a blow seems otherwise almost inexplicable. Henry made now
one of his most vigorous efforts to effect a passage; nothing, we are
told, could exceed his own personal
exertions.<a id="notetag127" name="notetag127"></a><a href="#note127">[127]</a>
The French had
broken up the lanes leading to the fords, and thrown every obstacle in
the way. However, nothing seemed able to resist his resolution; and in
a few hours the whole of his army had crossed. Great was the joy of
the English on having surmounted this formidable obstacle; and they
now hoped to reach Calais without a battle. But on the following day
two heralds came
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page162" name="page162">(p. 162)</a></span>
to announce to Henry the resolution of the
French to give him battle, and to take vengeance on him for invading
their country. Henry, without any change of countenance, with much
gentleness replied, "All would be done according to the will of God."
On the heralds then asking him by what route he proposed to proceed,
"Straight to Calais" was the reply. He then advised them not to
attempt to interrupt his march, but to avoid the shedding of Christian
blood. The heralds fell down upon their knees as they first approached
him; and on dismissing them, he gave them a hundred golden crowns.
From the hour of these heralds departing, Henry and his men always
wore their warrior-dress, in readiness for battle; and he spoke to his
army with much tenderness and spirit, and evidently with a powerful
effect. To his surprise, next morning none appeared to oppose him, and
he proceeded on his journey. Many circumstances happened from day to
day, and hour to hour, calculated to dispirit the English, by exciting
an assurance that the French army was near, and waiting their own time
to seize upon their prey; delaying only in order to make their utter
demolition more certain. Henry's route probably was taken through
Peronne, Albert,
Bonnieres,<a id="notetag128" name="notetag128"></a><a href="#note128">[128]</a>
Frevent; and he reached the river
Ternoise (called the River of Swords)
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page163" name="page163">(p. 163)</a></span>
without any remarkable
occurrence. No sooner, however, had he passed the Ternoise, and
mounted the hill not far from Maisoncelle, than a man came,
breathless, and told the Duke of York that the enemy was approaching
in countless numbers. Henry forthwith commanded the main body to halt,
and setting spurs to his horse hastened to view the enemy, who seemed
to him like an immense forest covering the whole country. Nothing
dismayed, he ordered his troops to dismount and prepare for battle;
animating them by his calm, intrepid bearing, and by his language of
kindness and encouragement. The French, who were first seen as they
were emerging from a valley a mile off in three columns, halted at the
distance of about half a mile.</p>

<p>The English felt assured that they would be immediately attacked; and,
as soon as they were drawn up in order of battle, they prepared for
death. The greatest want then felt in the camp was the lack of
priests,<a id="notetag129" name="notetag129"></a><a href="#note129">[129]</a>
every one being anxiously desirous of making confession
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page164" name="page164">(p. 164)</a></span>
and obtaining absolution. Henry's presence of mind, and noble
soul, and pious trust, and intrepid spirit, showed themselves on this
occasion in words which ought never to be forgotten. Sir Walter
Hungerford having expressed his sorrow that they had not ten thousand
of those gallant archers who would be most desirous of aiding their
King in his hour of need, the King rebuked him, saying, "He spoke
idly, for, as his hope was in God, in whom he trusted for victory, he
would not, if he could, increase his forces even by a single person;
for, if it was the pleasure of the Almighty, few as were his
followers, they were sufficient to chastise the confidence of the
enemy, who relied on their numbers."</p>

<p>About sun-set the French took up their quarters in the orchards and
villages of Agincourt and Ruissauville. Henry, anxiously seeking
lodgings for his exhausted soldiers, at length found in the village of
Maisoncelle a better supply for their wants than they had met with
since they left Harfleur; and a small hut afforded the King himself
protection from the
weather.<a id="notetag130" name="notetag130"></a><a href="#note130">[130]</a>
Before the English quitted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page165" name="page165">(p. 165)</a></span>
their position to go to Maisoncelle, Henry permitted all his prisoners
to depart, upon condition that if he gained the approaching battle,
they should return and surrender themselves; but, if he were defeated,
they should be released from their engagements. This night, through
nearly the whole of which rain fell heavily, was passed by the two
hostile armies, about one mile distant from each other, very
differently, but not inconsistently with their relative circumstances.
Both suffered severely from the weather as well as from fatigue; but
whilst the French, anticipating an easy and sure victory, played at
dice for their prisoners as their stake; the English, having prepared
their weapons for the conflict, betook themselves to prayer, and the
observance of the other ordinances of their religion.</p>

<p>At day-break, on Friday, October 25, the French drew up in order of
battle, in three lines, on the plain of Agincourt, through which was
the route
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page166" name="page166">(p. 166)</a></span>
to Calais. Of their numbers the accounts both of
English and French writers vary exceedingly, and it is impossible to
fix upon any amount with confidence; probably, however, at the very
lowest calculation they were more than fifty thousand men.</p>

<p>Henry was up at break of day, and immediately attended mass. He then,
mounted on a small grey horse, bearing on his coat the arms of France
and England, and wearing a magnificent crown on his head, drew up his
men in order of battle in an open field. His main body, consisting of
men-at-arms, he commanded himself; the vanguard was committed, as a
right wing, to the Duke of York at his own request; and the rear-guard
was posted, as a left wing, under the command of the Lord Camois. The
archers were placed between the wings in the form of a wedge, with
their poles fixed before them as a protection against the cavalry.
Henry then rode along the lines, and addressed them in a speech full
of spirit, well fitted to inspire in his men enthusiastic ardour and
devotedness. "Sir," was the reply, "we pray God to give you a good
life, and victory over your enemies." At this juncture (we are told by
one historian<a id="notetag131" name="notetag131"></a><a href="#note131">[131]</a>)
an attempt was made at negociation, but it failed;
Henry, in the midst of all his present perils, insisting virtually on
the same terms which he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page167" name="page167">(p. 167)</a></span>
had offered when in safety within
the realm of England.<a id="notetag132"
name="notetag132"></a><a href="#note132">[132]</a></p>

<p>The King assigned to the gallant veteran, Sir Thomas Erpingham, a
friend of Henry, no less venerable for his age than distinguished for
his bravery and military skill, the honourable duty of arraying his
host. He first calmly marshalled the troops, placing the archers
foremost and the men-at-arms behind them; and then, riding in front of
the line, exhorted his brother-warriors in the name of their prince to
fight valiantly. A third time did this aged and fearless knight ride
before the ranks which were stationed to receive the first shock of
the enemy, and if possible to turn back the apparently resistless and
overwhelming tide of battle; and then, having deliberately executed
his commission to the full, he threw up into the air the truncheon
which he held in his hand, shouting, "Now strike!" and, immediately
dismounting, joined the King and his attendants, who were all on foot.
When the soldiers saw the staff in the air, and heard the cry of the
veteran, they raised such a tremendous shout as startled the enemy,
and filled them with
amazement.<a id="notetag133" name="notetag133"></a><a href="#note133">[133]</a></p>

<p>It <span class="pagenum"><a id="page168" name="page168">(p. 168)</a></span>
was now approaching mid-day; when Henry, perceiving that
the enemy would not commence the attack, but were waiting either for
reinforcements, or in the hope of compelling him by want of provisions
to surrender, issued the command, "Banners, advance!" His soldiers
fell down instantly upon the ground prostrate, and implored the
Almighty to succour them; each, as it is said, putting a morsel of
earth into his mouth in remembrance of their mortality. They then
rose, and advanced firmly towards the enemy, shouting, and with the
sound of trumpets. The Constable of France commanded his advanced
guard to meet them, who instantly obeyed, with the war-cry "Montjoye!"
The battle commenced by a shower of arrows from the English, which did
great execution. The French cavalry were immediately thrown into
confusion, chiefly in consequence of the horses rushing on the pointed
stakes which were fixed before the English archers, and, maddened with
pain, turning upon their own ranks. The battle was then tremendously
obstinate: at one time, the shock of the French body caused the
English to give way; but it was only to rush again upon their enemies
with a renewed and still more impetuous and desperate attack. Their
charge, like a torrent of mighty waters, was resistless; and the
archers, having exhausted their quivers, and betaking themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page169" name="page169">(p. 169)</a></span>
to their swords and bills and hatchets, the slaughter among the
ranks of the French was dreadful. The Duke of Alençon endeavoured in
vain to rally his men, now giving way, and being worsted on every
side; and, returning himself to the struggle, he fell in single combat
with King Henry himself. Whilst the conflict was raging, Anthony, Duke
of Brabant, came up with such of his forces as could keep pace with
him in his rapid haste towards the field of battle, and instantly
mingled in the thickest of the fight: he fell too; gallantly, but
unsuccessfully, striving to stem the flood. The battle seemed now to
be decided, when that event took place, which every one must lament,
and which nothing but necessity could justify,&mdash;</p>


<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">THE SLAUGHTER OF THE PRISONERS AT AGINCOURT.</span></p>

<p>The name of Henry of Monmouth is inseparable from the Battle of
Agincourt; and immeasurably better had it been for his fair fame had
himself and his little army been crushed in that tremendous struggle,
by the overwhelming chivalry of France, than that he should have
stained that day of conquest and glory by an act of cruelty or
vengeance. If any cause except palpable and inevitable necessity could
be proved to have suggested the dreadful mandate for his soldiers to
put their prisoners to the sword, his memory must be branded by a
stigma which no personal courage, not a whole
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page170" name="page170">(p. 170)</a></span>
life devoted
to deeds of arms, nor any unprecedented career of conquest, could
obliterate. The charge of cruelty, however, like some other
accusations, examined at length in these Memoirs, is of comparatively
recent origin; and as in those former instances, so in this, our duty
is to ascertain the facts from the best evidence, and dispassionately
to draw our inference from those facts after an upright scrutiny and
patient weighing of the whole question in all its bearings. Our
abhorrence of the crime may well make us hesitate before we pronounce
judgment against one to whose mercy and chivalrous honour his
contemporaries bore willing and abundant testimony; the enormity of so
dreadful an example compels us, in the name of humanity and of
justice, not to screen the guilty. We may be wisely jealous of the
bias and prejudice which his brilliant talents, and his life of
patriotism and glory, may unconsciously communicate to our minds; we
must be also upon our guard lest an excessive resolution to do
justice, foster imperceptibly a morbid acquiescence in the
condemnation of the accused.</p>

<p>The facts, then, as they are gleaned from those authors who wrote
nearest to the time (two of whom, one French, the other English, were
actually themselves present on the field of battle, and were
eye-witnesses of some portion at least of the circumstances which they
narrate,) seem to have been these, in their order and character.</p>

<p>At <span class="pagenum"><a id="page171" name="page171">(p. 171)</a></span>
the close of one of the most desperate struggles ever
recorded in the annals of ancient or modern warfare, whilst the enemy
were in the act of quitting the field, but had not left it, the
English were employing what remained of their well nigh exhausted
strength in guarding their prisoners, and separating the living from
the dead, who lay upon each other, heaps upon heaps, in one confused
and indiscriminate mass. On a sudden a shout was raised, and reached
Henry, that a fresh
reinforcement<a id="notetag134" name="notetag134"></a><a href="#note134">[134]</a>
of the enemy in overwhelming
numbers had attacked the baggage, and were advancing in battle-array
against him. He was himself just released from the furious conflict in
which, at the close of his almost unparalleled personal exertion, he
engaged with the Duke of Alençon, and slew him on the spot. Precisely,
also, at this juncture, the main body of the French who had been
engaged in the battle, and were apparently retreating, were seen to be
collecting in great numbers, and forming themselves into bodies,
throughout the plain, with the purpose, as it appeared, of returning
to the engagement.</p>

<p>To delay might have been the total sacrifice of himself and his
gallant little band; to hesitate might
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page172" name="page172">(p. 172)</a></span>
have been death.
Henry instantly, without a moment's interval, by sound of trumpet
ordered his men to form themselves, and attack the body who were
advancing upon his rear, and to put the prisoners to death, "lest they
should rush upon his men during the fight." These mandates were
obeyed.<a id="notetag135" name="notetag135"></a><a href="#note135">[135]</a>
The French reinforcement, advancing from the quarter
where the baggage was stationed, no sooner felt a shower of arrows,
and saw a body of men ready to give them battle, than they turned to
flight; and instantly Henry, on seeing them run, stopped the slaughter
of the prisoners, and made it known to all that he had had recourse to
the measure only in self-defence. Henry, in order to prevent the
recurrence of such a dreadful catastrophe, sent forthwith a herald to
those companies of the enemy who were still lingering very
suspiciously through the field, and charged them either to come to
battle at once, or to withdraw from his sight; adding, that, should
they array themselves afterwards to renew the battle, he would show no
mercy, nor spare either fighting-men or prisoners.</p>

<p>Of the general accuracy of this statement of the facts little doubt
can be entertained, though in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page173" name="page173">(p. 173)</a></span>
midst of the confusion of
such a battle-field it would not be matter of surprise were some of
the circumstances mistaken or exaggerated. In reflecting on this
course of incidents, the thought forces itself upon our mind, that the
mandate was given, not in cool blood, nor when there was time and
opportunity for deliberation and for calculating upon the means and
chances of safety, but upon the instant, on a sudden unexpected
renewal of the engagement from a quarter from which no danger was
anticipated; at a moment, too, when, just after the heat of the battle
was passing over, the routed enemy were collecting again in great
numbers in various parts of the field, with a view evidently of
returning to the charge and crushing their conquerors; at a moment,
too, when the English were scattered about, separating the living from
the dead, and all was yet confusion and uncertainty. Another fact, as
clearly and distinctly recorded as the original issuing of the
mandate, is, that no sooner was the danger of the immediate and
inevitable sacrifice of the lives of his men removed by the retreat of
the assailants, than, without waiting for the dispersion of those
menacing bodies then congregating around him, Henry instantly
countermanded the order, and saved the remainder of the prisoners. The
bare facts of the case, from first to last, admit of no other
alternative than for our judgment to pronounce it to have been
altogether an imperative inevitable act of self-preservation, without
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page174" name="page174">(p. 174)</a></span>
the sacrifice of any life, or the suffering of any human
being, beyond the absolute and indispensable necessity of the case.</p>

<p>But, perhaps, the most striking and conclusive testimony in
vindication of Henry's character on that day of slaughter and victory,
is borne both by the silence and also by the expressed sentiments of
the contemporary historians. This evidence deserves to be put more
prominently forward than it has ever yet been. Indeed, as long as
there was no charge of cruelty, or unnecessary violence, brought
against his name in this particular, there was little need of alleging
any evidence in his defence. It remained for modern writers, after a
lapse of centuries, to stigmatize the command as an act of barbarity,
and to represent it as having tarnished and stained the victory of him
who gave it.<a id="notetag136" name="notetag136"></a><a href="#note136">[136]</a>
It is, however, a most remarkable and satisfactory
circumstance that, of the contemporary historians, and those who
followed most closely upon them, who have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page175" name="page175">(p. 175)</a></span>
detailed the
proceedings with more or less minuteness, and with a great variety
though no inconsistency of circumstances, in whose views, moreover,
all subsequent writers, with few exceptions, have unreservedly
acquiesced, not one single individual is found to cast the slightest
imputation on Henry for injustice or cruelty; while some, in their
account of the battle, have not made the most distant allusion to the
circumstance. All the earlier writers who refer to it appear, with one
consent, to have considered the order as the result of dire and
unavoidable necessity on the part of the English King. Not only so:
whilst no one who witnessed the engagement, or lived at the time, ever
threw the shadow of reproach or of complaint on Henry or his army,
various writers, especially among the French historians, join in
reprobating the unjustifiable conduct of those among the French troops
who rendered the massacre inevitable, and cast on their own countrymen
the entire responsibility and blame for the whole melancholy affair.
Instead of any attempt to sully and tarnish the glory won by the
English on that day, by pointing to their cruel and barbarous
treatment of unarmed prisoners, they visit their own people with the
very strongest terms of malediction, as the sole culpable origin and
cause of the evil. And that these were not only the sentiments of the
writers themselves, but were participated in by their countrymen at
large, is evidenced by the record of a fact which has been generally
overlooked. Those who were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page176" name="page176">(p. 176)</a></span>
deemed guilty of thus exposing
their countrymen to death, by unjustifiably renewing the attack when
the conflict was acknowledged to be over, and after the French
soldiery had given up the field, not only were exposed to disgrace in
their characters, but suffered punishment also for the offence in
their persons. Anticipating censure and severe handling as the
consequences of their misconduct, they made valuable presents to such
as they thought able to screen them; but so decided was the
indignation and resentment of their countrymen, that the leaders of
the offending parties were cast into prison, and suffered a long
confinement, as the punishment for their misconduct on that day.</p>

<p>The inference, then, which the facts, as they are delivered by English
and French writers, compel us to draw, coincides with the professed
sentiments of all contemporaries. Those, on the one hand, who shared
the glory and were proud of the day of Agincourt, and those, on the
other, whose national pride, and wounded honour, and participation in
the calamities poured that day upon the noblest families of France,
and in the mourning spread far and wide throughout the land, caused
them to abhor the very name of Agincourt, all sanction our adoption of
that one inference: <i>Henry did not stain his victory by any act of
cruelty</i>. His character comes out of the investigation untarnished by
a suspicion of his having wantonly shed the blood of a single
fellow-creature.</p>

<p>To <span class="pagenum"><a id="page177" name="page177">(p. 177)</a></span>
enable the reader to judge for himself how far the view
taken in the text is justified by the evidence, the Author has thought
it desirable to cite from different writers, French as well as
English, the passages at length in which they describe the
transaction.</p>

<div class="letter">
<p>
     The Chaplain of Henry V, an eye-witness, who was himself
     stationed with the baggage, and whose account is contained in the
     fasciculus known as "MS. Sloane, 1776, p. 67," thus reports the
     transaction:</p>

<p>"When some of the enemy's foreranks were slain, those behind
     pressed over the dead, and others again falling on them were
     immediately put to death; and near Henry's banners so large was
     the pile of corpses, and of those who were thrown upon them, that
     the English stood on heaps which exceeded a man's height, and
     felled their adversaries below with swords and axes. And when, at
     length, for the space of two or three hours, that powerful body
     of the first ranks had been broken through and crushed to pieces,
     and the rest were forced to fly, our men began to move those
     heaps, and to separate the living from the dead. And behold,
     suddenly, with what angry dispensation of Providence it is not
     known, (nescitur in quâ irâ Dei,) a shout is made that the
     cavalry of the enemy in an overwhelming and fresh body were
     rallying, and forming themselves to attack our men, few in
     number, and worn out with fatigue. And the captives, without any
     respect of persons, (except the Dukes of Orleans and Bourbon, and
     certain other illustrious men, and a few besides,) were put the
     sword, to prevent their becoming our ruin in the approaching
     struggle. And, after a little while, the enemy, (by the
     Almighty's will,) having tasted the sharpness of our arrows, and
     seeing that our King was approaching them, left us a field of
     blood, with chariots and many other carriages filled
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page178" name="page178">(p. 178)</a></span>
     with provisions and weapons, lances and bows."
</p>

<p>Jean Le Fevre, Seigneur de St. Remy, who was also an eye-witness,
being present in the English camp, records the event, and his own
opinion of it, thus:</p>

<p>
     "Then there befel them a very great misfortune; for a large body
     of the rear-guard, in which were many French, Bretons, Gascons,
     and others, who had betaken themselves to flight, and had with
     them a large number of standards and flags, showed signs of an
     intention to fight, and were marching in order. When the English
     perceived them thus congregated, orders were given by the King of
     England for every one to slay his prisoners; but those who had
     taken them were unwilling to put them to death, because they had
     taken those only who could give a high ransom. On the King being
     apprised that they would not kill their prisoners, he gave in
     charge to a gentleman with two hundred archers to put them all to
     death. The order of the King was obeyed by this esquire, which
     was a lamentable affair; for all that body of French nobility
     were <i>in cold blood</i> cut and hewed, head and face,&mdash;a wonderful
     thing to see. <span class="smcap">That accursed band of Frenchmen, who thus caused
     that noble chivalry to be murdered</span>, when they saw that the
     English were ready to receive them and give them battle, betook
     themselves to flight suddenly; and those who could, saved
     themselves; and the greater part of those who were on horseback
     saved themselves, but of them who were on foot the greater part
     were put to death."</p>

<p>Elmham thus records the transaction:&mdash;</p>

<p>
     "The English, already wearied, and for the most part destitute of
     arms fit for a charge, when the French were arraying themselves
     for battle with a view to the renewal of the conflict, fearing
     lest the persons they had taken should rush upon them in the
     struggle, slew many of them, though
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page179" name="page179">(p. 179)</a></span>
noble, with the
     sword. The King then, by a herald, commanded those French
     soldiers who were still occupying the field either to come to
     battle at once, or speedily to depart out of his sight; assuring
     them that, if they should again array themselves for a renewed
     engagement, both they and the prisoners yet remaining should
     perish without mercy, with the most dire vengeance which the
     English could inflict."
</p>

<p>Fabyan's account differs from that of other writers only in one
particular; he represents the retirement of the French, who had
rallied for a renewal of the conflict, to have been the result of the
message sent to them by the Duke of Orleans and his fellow-prisoners,
in their panic on hearing Henry's mandate, which seemed to put their
lives into immediate jeopardy.</p>

<p>
     "When the King, by power and grace of God more than by force of
     man, had gotten this triumphant victory, and returned his people
     from the chase of his enemies, tidings were brought to him that a
     new host of Frenchmen were coming towards him. Wherefore he
     commanded his people to be embattled; and, that done, made
     proclamation through the host that every man should slay his
     prisoners: by reason of which proclamation the Duke of Orleans,
     and the other lords of France, were in such fear, that anon, by
     the licence of the King, they sent such word unto the said host
     that they withdrew."
</p>

<p>The contemporary author whose work is translated by Laboureur, having
in impassioned language spoken of the "eternal reproach, and ever
deplorable calamity of the miserable battle of Agincourt," instead of
attempting to make the English partake in any degree of the disgrace
which on that day stained the annals of France, tells us that Henry,
believing a great body of the vanguard, who had been broken through,
were running, not in flight, but to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page180" name="page180">(p. 180)</a></span>
join the rest of the
army and renew the attack, gave orders for all the prisoners to be put
to the sword; and the carnage lasted till it was known they were
actually running away. He then stopped it; and explained that his
orders were given in doubt of the enemy's intentions.&mdash;This writer
seems to have been mistaken in his view of the circumstances; but the
thought of Henry having acted unjustifiably does not seem to have
crossed his mind.</p>

<p>Monstrelet's account is somewhat different from the two last, and more
full in its details:</p>

<p>
     "During the heat of the combat the English made several
     prisoners; and then came news to the King of England that the
     French were attacking them from the rear, and that they had
     already taken his sumpter-horses and baggage. This was true; for
     Robinet de Bournonville and Rifflart de Clamasse, Ysambert
     d'Azencourt, and some other men-at-arms, accompanied by six
     hundred peasants, went to plunder the baggage, and carried off a
     great quantity of the property of the camp, and a large number of
     horses, whilst those who were their guards were engaged in the
     battle. This pillage caused the King great trouble, for he saw
     also at the same time in the open field those French who had
     taken to flight rallying themselves in companies; and he doubted
     whether their intention was not to renew the engagement. He
     therefore caused a proclamation to be made by sound of trumpet,
     that every Englishman should on pain of
death<a id="notetag137" name="notetag137"></a><a href="#note137">[137]</a>
slay his
     prisoners, to prevent their succouring their own people in the
     time of need; and then, on the sudden, followed a very great
     carnage of French prisoners. For which proceeding, Robinet de
     Bournonville and Ysambart d'Azencourt were afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page181" name="page181">(p. 181)</a></span>
     punished and imprisoned a long time by order of John Duke of
     Burgundy, notwithstanding they had given to Philip Earl of
     Charolois, his son, an exceedingly valuable sword, studded with
     precious stones and jewels, belonging to the King of England,
     which they had found and taken with the other booty, that the
     Earl might interest himself for them should any trouble overtake
     them in consequence of this circumstance."</p>

<p>Des Ursins represents the catastrophe to have been occasioned by
     the news spread through the field that the Duke of Brittany was
     arrived with a powerful reinforcement, on which the French
     rallied. He gives, however, two accounts; in one of which he
     reports the prisoners taken by the English to be fourteen
     thousand, a number exceeding the whole body of fighting men in
     the English army.</p>

<p>Paradin de Cuyseault, in his Annals of Burgundy, marks very
     strongly in how serious a light the offence of the French
     assailants was viewed by their contemporaries:</p>

<p>"And this [the order for the slaughter of the prisoners] was
     executed, of which the said Bournonville and Azencourt were the
     cause: and they being accused of this charge before the Duke of
     Burgundy, his will was that they should suffer death: but the
     Earl of Charolois saved them, in return for the beautiful sword."</p>

<p>Pierre de Fenin, a contemporary esquire, and a clerk of the
     household to Charles VI, employs expressions very pointedly
     exculpatory of the English; he does not speak of Henry's mandate
     at all:</p>

<p>"Whilst the battle between the English and French <i>was yet
     pending and going on</i>, and the English had already almost gained
     the mastery, Isambert d'Azencourt, and Robinet de Bournonville,
     accompanied by some men-at-arms of little note, made an assault
     on the baggage of the English, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page182" name="page182">(p. 182)</a></span>
caused a great
     [affray] terror. When the English saw that it was the French who
     were coming upon them to attack them, <i>in that necessity they
     felt themselves obliged</i> to put to death many whom they had
     already made prisoners; for which the two persons above mentioned
     were afterwards made the objects of severe execration, and were
     also punished for the offence by the Duke of
Burgundy."<a id="notetag138" name="notetag138"></a><a href="#note138">[138]</a>
</p></div>

<p>Among the many instances of heroism which occurred during the battle,
Henry's conduct was particularly distinguished. He fought on foot like
a lion, as our annalists express themselves, and was throughout the
noblest example of valour. Especially was his gallant rescue of his
brother, the Duke of Gloucester, remembered with admiration. That
prince had been wounded by a dagger, and thrown on the ground by the
Duke of Alençon and his soldiers, when Henry rushed between them, and
defended his brother till he was removed from the conflict. This noble
deed nearly cost him his life; for, stooping down to raise his
brother, the Duke of Alençon,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page183" name="page183">(p. 183)</a></span>
or one of his men, struck him
such a blow as to break off a part of his crown.</p>

<p>The loss on both sides has been very variously reported. Probably of
the French not less than ten thousand fell in that field of
blood;<a id="notetag139" name="notetag139"></a><a href="#note139">[139]</a>
of the English perhaps less than one-tenth of that number.
But France did not on that day reckon her loss by the number of the
slain; the chief of her
chivalry<a id="notetag140" name="notetag140"></a><a href="#note140">[140]</a>
and nobility
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page184" name="page184">(p. 184)</a></span> fell
there. On the English side the only men of note who were slain in the
battle were the Duke of York, the Earl of Suffolk, Sir Richard
Keghley, Thomas Fitz-Henry, John de Peniton, and David
Gamme.<a id="notetag141" name="notetag141"></a><a href="#note141">[141]</a></p>

<p>The last-mentioned person is that David Gamme who
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page185" name="page185">(p. 185)</a></span> was
ransomed from Owyn Glendowr, and who is reported to have replied, when
questioned as to the number of the enemy, "My liege, there are enough
to be slain, enough to be taken prisoners, and enough to run away!"
This gallant speech of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page186" name="page186">(p. 186)</a></span>
David Gamme immediately before the
battle, has been delivered down from father to son among his Cambrian
compatriots with feelings of exultation and pride. A circumstance of a
very opposite character and tendency (which has never, it is believed,
hitherto appeared in our histories,) must not be suppressed here.
Among those who swelled the enormous host which on that day gave
battle to the King of England, were found natives of his own
Principality. During the dreadful devastations caused by Owyn
Glyndowr, great numbers left their mansions and estates a prey to his
fury, and saved themselves from personal violence by taking refuge in
England, or beyond the seas. Many, too, of those who had made
themselves notorious as Owyn's partisans, fled from Wales when his
cause began to falter, and avoided the penalty of perseverance in
their rebellion, or the humiliating alternative of submission to one
whom they deemed a tyrant and usurper. Quitting their native soil in
the enjoyment of health and strength, not a few of these inhabitants
of the Principality enlisted under the standard of foreign powers;
especially (as it is reasonable to conclude) of the King of France,
who had espoused the cause for which they were expatriated. How large
or how small a number of Welshmen fell in the ranks of the French on
that day, or how many escaped, we have no means of ascertaining. Our
attention is drawn to the subject by the record of a fact too
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page187" name="page187">(p. 187)</a></span>
specific, and too well authenticated, to be doubted or
evaded.<a id="notetag142" name="notetag142"></a><a href="#note142">[142]</a>
William Gwyn of Llanstephan, was in the army of the enemy
on the field of Agincourt, and his corpse was found among the slain.
His castle of Llanstephan was in consequence forfeited to the crown,
and was granted to the King's brother, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>Being left master of the field, Henry withdrew his army a few paces,
and addressed them in a speech very characteristic of his mind. After
thanking them for their services, he bade them consider his success as
undoubted proof of the justice of his cause; and directed them not to
pride themselves on the event, but to give the glory to God. Henry
then called to him Montjoye, the principal herald of France, and
demanded of him to whom the victory belonged; who replied, that it was
to the King of England. He then asked the name of the neighbouring
castle; and, being informed that it was Agincourt, "Then," said he,
"this shall for ever be called</p>

<p class="figcenter"><span class="smcap">"THE BATTLE OF AGINCOURT."</span><a id="notetag143"
name="notetag143"></a><a href="#note143">[143]</a></p>

<p>Henry, naturally anxious to hasten with his troops beyond the reach of
his enemies, and to arrive at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page188" name="page188">(p. 188)</a></span>
Calais before they could
recover from their present overwhelming distress, removed from his
quarters, passing through the field of battle early on the next day,
taking his prisoners with him. Many vague expressions occur in some
writers, which might be wrested to imply wanton cruelty in the English
after the battle; but no direct charge of the sort is brought
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page189" name="page189">(p. 189)</a></span>
against them; and we may reasonably hope that there was no more
of human suffering than of necessity followed so tremendous a
conflict: whilst all writers agree in recording and extolling the
kindness, and compassion, and courtesy shown by Henry to his
prisoners, especially to the Duke of Orleans; endeavouring by all
means in his power to cheer and console them. Just as after the battle
of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page190" name="page190">(p. 190)</a></span>
Grosmont, when he was only seventeen years old, so now in
the prime of manhood, on the field of Agincourt, we find in him the
same kind and warm-hearted conqueror: "In battle a lion; but, duty
appeased, in mercy a lamb!"</p>

<p>The army found great difficulty at Calais from the scarcity of
provisions; and the prisoners, as may be supposed, were in still
greater distress. The moment Henry, who was staying at Guisnes, heard
of it, he ordered vessels to be procured to convey both soldiers and
prisoners to England. Henry himself reached
Calais<a id="notetag144" name="notetag144"></a><a href="#note144">[144]</a>
on the 29th of
October, and was received with every demonstration of loyalty. He was
met by the clergy singing Te Deum; whilst the inhabitants shouted,
"Welcome the King, our Sovereign Lord!" News reached London very
early, whilst the citizens were yet in bed, on Tuesday, October 29;
and on that day the victory was celebrated by religious processions,
in which we are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page191" name="page191">(p. 191)</a></span>
told the Queen Dowager joined, though
Arthur, Count of Richmond, her own son, was among the prisoners. On
Monday, November 4, the Duke of Bedford announced the welcome news
officially to parliament. Henry embarked for England on Saturday, 16th
of November, and reached Dover late on the same day, though the wind
had been very boisterous, and one or two of his vessels were lost. So
overflowing was the joy and zeal of his subjects, that we are told
they rushed into the sea, and brought him to shore in their arms. At
Canterbury he was met by the archbishop and clergy: on Friday, 22nd of
November, he slept at Eltham. The next day he was met, about ten
o'clock, at Blackheath, by the Mayor and all the civic authorities of
London, dressed in their most splendid robes, and accompanied by not
less than twenty thousand citizens on horseback.</p>

<p>In London a most magnificent pageant was ready to welcome him. Minute
descriptions of the various devices, such probably as England had
never seen before, have come down to us. But we need take no further
notice of them than to remark, that during the splendid scene, which
lasted from ten o'clock till three, (in the course of which Henry
humbly returned thanks both in St. Paul's and in Westminster Abbey,)
the King's deportment was singularly modest. His dress was simple; he
rode gravely on, attended by a small retinue; and, his thoughts
apparently wrapped up in contemplating the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page192" name="page192">(p. 192)</a></span>
power and
goodness of the Almighty, he seemed altogether indifferent to the
splendour of the scenes and the devotedness of the crowds through
which he passed. So anxious was he to avoid exciting the applause of
his people, that he would not allow the helmet which he wore at
Agincourt to be exhibited on this occasion; the battered state of
which bore evidence to the danger he had encountered: nor would he
allow the minstrels to compose verses, or sing songs, to his praise;
but persisted in attributing the glory of his victory to God alone.</p>

<p>It is pleasing to trace the
rewards<a id="notetag145" name="notetag145"></a><a href="#note145">[145]</a>
bestowed by Henry on his
companions in arms at Agincourt, and the measures which he adopted to
preserve their names from oblivion. With this view he doubtless caused
a roll to be made recording their names; though only a transcript of
one part has been yet discovered among the archives. We may hope that
not many years will elapse before numbers of those most interesting
documents which now lie buried in heaps of confusion will be brought
to light. Henry selected to fill every vacancy in the order of the
Garter, (not bestowed on sovereign princes,) the peers and
distinguished commanders who fought with him at Agincourt; and when he
restricted the use of coats of arms in a subsequent expedition to
those who could prove their right to them, he excepts those only who
bore arms with him at Agincourt. To commemorate this victory with more
especial <span class="pagenum"><a id="page193" name="page193">(p. 193)</a></span>
honour, he created a King-at-arms, called
"Agincourt."</p>

<p>Our reformed views of Christian truth must not make us undervalue the
testimony borne to Henry's gratitude towards his companions in arms,
though they were removed by death from all earthly favours and
rewards. He did for them what he could; and though we believe him to
have been performing a vain office, and profitless to those whom it
was intended to benefit, in the prevailing superstition of those days
we see traces of the kindness and grateful spirit of the
hero.<a id="notetag146" name="notetag146"></a><a href="#note146">[146]</a></p>

<p>Many of the French princes taken at Agincourt remained prisoners in
England for many years. The Duke of Bourbon died in confinement. The
Duke of Orleans was not released for five-and-twenty years. Whilst a
captive in the Tower of London, he had recourse to the solace of
literature; and composed many pieces of poetry, still preserved in the
British
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page194" name="page194">(p. 194)</a></span>
Museum, which indicate genius and cultivated taste.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>How highly the people of England valued this victory is seen in very
many particulars. The superstition of those times was also made to
contribute to its celebrity. The victory of Agincourt was gained on
the feast of the Translation of St. John of Beverley, and was ascribed
to his merits. His festival had before been kept on the 7th of May;
but now it was ordained to be celebrated for ever on the 25th of
October. But that was the feast of Crispin and Crispianus; and so the
authorities of the church decreed that all three saints should share
in the offices of that
day.<a id="notetag147" name="notetag147"></a><a href="#note147">[147]</a></p>

<p>The Archbishop declares that this ecclesiastical constitution was made
in full convocation by the will, counsel, and consent of all his
brothers, and also at the special instance of their most Christian
King.</p>

<p>The document abounds to the overflow with the gross superstition of
the age. It is only by recalling what that degrading superstition was,
that we can estimate at their proper value the blessings of the
Reformation. Of the genuineness of this document there can be no
doubt. It was addressed by Henry Chicheley, Archbishop of Canterbury,
to the Vicar of the Bishop of London, who was then at the council of
Constance; and its preamble at least deserves a place here.</p>

<div class="letter">
<p>"Henry,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page195" name="page195">(p. 195)</a></span>
by divine permission, Archbishop of Canterbury,
     Primate of all England, and Legate of the Apostolic see, to our
     beloved son the spiritual Vicar-general of our venerable brother
     R. by the grace of God, Bishop of London, now in foreign parts.
     The holy honour of the English church (whose praise and fame, in
     devoted veneration of God and his saints, the whole world extols
     above the churches of other regions and provinces,) requires that
     the same church shall more abound with the praises of those, and
     more exultingly rejoice in glad devotion to them, by whose
     patronage and grace of miracles she rejoices to flourish; and by
     whose pious intercession the state, not only of the church, but
     of the whole realm, together with the inward sweetness of peace
     and quiet, and with victory gained over foreign enemies, is
     defended by just rulers.</p>

<p> "The grace of this help, though God to the same church, and to
     the inhabitants of the realm of England, hath often decreed to
     show by the merits of divers saints, (with whom she shines
     gloriously on every side,) yet in these last days He has
     evidently deigned more miraculously and more especially to
     console the aforesaid church, together with the aforesaid nobles,
     inhabitants, and all members of the kingdom, by the especial
     suffrage of her (almifici) gracious confessor and bishop, the
     most blessed John of Beverley, as we verily believe!</p>

<p>"Oh! ineffable consolation, especially in our times, in every age
     pleasant, and ever to be called to mind; namely, the victory of
     our most Christian Prince, King Henry V. of England, and of his
     army, in the battle of Agincourt, lately fought in the parts of
     Picardy; which on the Feast of the Translation of the said Saint,
     to the honour of the divine name, and to the honour of the realm
     of England, from the boundless mercy of God, was granted to the
     English.</p>

<p>"On which Feast of his Translation, whilst the struggle between
     our countrymen and the French was being carried on, as to the
     hearing of us and our brethren in our last convocation,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page196" name="page196">(p. 196)</a></span>
     abundantly and especially, the true report of the inhabitants of
     that country brought the tidings, that from his tomb sacred oil
     flowed, drops falling as of sweat, indicative of the divine mercy
     towards his people, doubtless obtained by the merits of that most
     holy man.</p>

<p>"Wishing, therefore, in our province to spread an increase of
     divine worship, and especially to extol further the praise of so
     great a patron, with the wills, counsel, and assent of our
     brethren and the clergy in the said convocation, and no less at
     the special instance of the said most Christian Prince, we have
     determined that the memory of that most holy confessor everywhere
     throughout our province should be exalted with feelings of
     prayers and devotions [votivis et devotis affectibus]."</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">

<p>Then follows the decree above mentioned.</p>

<p>This mass of extravagant folly and blind superstition, this
presumptuous sharing of God's omnipotence and sovereign might with the
power of such poor erring fellow-mortals as the corrupt ministers of a
corrupt church had presumptuously ranked among the inhabitants of
heaven,&mdash;thus daring to forestal the judgment of Christ at the last
day, and to pronounce on the glory of a man whose spiritual state
Omniscience alone can know,&mdash;it is impossible to contemplate without
feelings of gratitude that Heaven's mercy has released us from such
perverted use of the Gospel of the Saviour; nor without a prayer that
the Spirit of light and truth would guide those of our
fellow-creatures who are still walking in the same land of darkness
and error, into the clear light of Christian truth.</p>

Author, to whom the following "Song of Agincourt" has
been familiar from his childhood, cannot refrain from inserting it
here. This is that ancient, and, as it is believed, contemporary
ballad, which has preserved to our times that golden stanza which
appears in the title page of these volumes; and every word of which
reflects the character of Henry as a hero and a merciful man. The
quotation, also, from Burnet's History of Music, and the contemporary

<p>What news, what news, my trusty page?<br>
<span class="poem1">What news, what news dost thou bring to me?</span><br>
I bring such news from the King of France,<br>
<span class="poem1">That you and he can never agree.</span></p>

<p>He says you are young, and of tender age,<br>
<span class="poem1">Not fit to come up to his degree;</span><br>
He has sent you home some tennis-balls,<br>
<span class="poem1">That with them you may learn for to play.</span></p>

<span class="poem1">And Derby hills that are so free;</span><br>
But neither married man, nor widow's son,<br>
<span class="poem1">No widow's curse shall go with me!</span></p>

<p>They called up Cheshire and Lancashire,<br>
<span class="poem1">And Derby hills that are so free;</span><br>
But neither married man nor widow's son,<br>
<span class="poem1">Yet they had a right good company.</span></p>

<p>He called unto him his merry men all,<br>
<span class="poem1">And numbered them by three and three,</span><br>
Until their number it did amount<br>
<span class="poem1">To thirty thousand stout men and three.</span></p>

<p>Away then marched they into French land,<br>
<span class="poem1">With drums and fifes so merrily;</span><br>
Then out and spoke the King of France,<br>
<span class="poem1">Lo! here comes proud King Henrie!</span></p>

<p>The first that fired, it was the French,<br>
<span class="poem1">They killed our Englishmen so free;</span><br>
But we killed ten thousand of the French,<br>
<span class="poem1">And the rest of them they did run away.</span></p>

<p>Then marched they on to Paris gates,<br>
<span class="poem1">With drums and fifes so merrily;</span><br>
Oh! then bespoke the King of France,<br>
<span class="poem1">The Lord have mercy on my men and me!</span></p>

<p>Oh! I will send him his tribute home,<br>
<span class="poem1">Ten ton of gold that is due from me;</span><br>
And the very best flower that is in all France<br>
<span class="poem1">To the rose of England will I give free.</span></p>

the coronation of Henry V," observes Dr. Burney, "in
1413, we hear of <i>no other instruments than
harps</i>;<a id="notetag149" name="notetag149"></a><a href="#note149">[149]</a>
but one of
that prince's
historians<a id="notetag150" name="notetag150"></a><a href="#note150">[150]</a>
tells us that their number in the hall
was prodigious. Henry, however, though a successful hero and a
conqueror, did not seem to take the advantage of his claim to praise;
and either was so modest or so tasteless as to discourage and even
prohibit the poets and musicians from celebrating his victories and
singing his valiant deeds. When he entered the city of London, after
the battle of Agincourt, the gates and streets were hung with
tapestry, representing the history of ancient heroes; and children
were placed in temporary turrets to sing verses. But Henry, disgusted
at these vanities, commanded, by a formal edict, that for the future
no songs should be recited by harpers, or others, in honour of the
recent victory. '<i>Cantus de suo triumpho fieri, seu per citharistas,
vel alios quoscunque, cantari, penitus prohibebat</i>.'</p>

<p>"It is somewhat extraordinary that, in spite of Henry's edicts and
prohibitions, <i>the only English song of so early a date, that has come
to my knowledge, of which the original music has been preserved</i>, is
one that was written on his victory at Agincourt in 1415. It is
preserved in the Pepysian Collection, at Magdalen College,
Cambridge."<a id="notetag151"

<p>After
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page201" name="page201">(p. 201)</a></span>
some observations upon the general ignorance of the
transcribers of ancient music, Dr. Burney proceeds to say, "that the
copy in the Pepysian Collection is written upon vellum in Gregorian
notes, and can be little less ancient than the event which it
recorded;" and that there is with it a paper which shows that an
attempt was made in the last century (17th) to give it a modern dress,
but that too many liberties had been taken with the melody, and the
drone bass, which had been set to it for the lute, is a mere jargon.
He then presents what he says is a faithful copy of this venerable
relic of our nation's prowess and glory.</p>

1415-1417.</h3>


<p>It has been made a subject of observation, and of conjecture as to its
cause, that Henry did not take advantage of the next spring to
prosecute his claims in France.
Some<a id="notetag153" name="notetag153"></a><a href="#note153">[153]</a>
would have us suspect that
it was "to show that personal honour had been his leading object, that
he remained at home nearly two years afterwards without any military
movement." But a much more intelligible and palpable cause
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page204" name="page204">(p. 204)</a></span>
offers itself to the mind on the slightest reflection upon the
circumstances in which he was
placed.<a id="notetag154" name="notetag154"></a><a href="#note154">[154]</a>
He had not the means ready
for invading France. His forces were diminished by a number of men
appallingly great, in proportion to the body with which he had landed
at Harfleur; and his treasury was exhausted. For his first expedition
he had borrowed the utmost which his subjects and friends either would
or could supply; and the grants made to him by his parliament had been
anticipated even to carry on the former campaign. That it was his
intention, however, when he left France after the victory of
Agincourt, to return to that country in the following spring, seems
clear from the circumstance that, on dismissing his less illustrious
prisoners at Calais, he bound them on their words to bring their
ransoms to him on the field of Lendi, at the feast of St. John in the
summer; with this voluntary proviso, that, if they did not find him
there, they should be free from all obligation to him.</p>

<p>In the mean time, a most influential mediator between the two kingdoms
appeared, the intervention of whom would, even under other
circumstances, have rendered delay imperative. Sigismund, Emperor
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page205" name="page205">(p. 205)</a></span>
of Germany, first visited the King of France in his capital, and
then extended his journey to England, with a view of bringing about a
peace, though all his efforts proved unavailing.</p>

<p>On his approach towards England, the utmost pains seem to have been
taken to make his reception worthy of his high dignity and of the
English people. The orders of council are very minute and
interesting;<a id="notetag155" name="notetag155"></a><a href="#note155">[155]</a>
and the arrival of Sigismund seems to have occupied
the time and thoughts of the whole nation. The Earl of Warwick was
then Captain of Calais, whose character for gallantry and courteous
bearing was so distinguished on this, as on all other occasions, that
he was called the Father of courtesy. The Emperor and his retinue of
one thousand persons, among whom were many German and Italian princes
and nobles, embarked at Calais in thirty of the King's ships, and
arrived at Dover on the 29th of April 1416. Here the Duke
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page206" name="page206">(p. 206)</a></span> of
Gloucester, Constable of Dover, with many noblemen, met him; and gave
him precisely that sort of reception which we should have expected
from English gentlemen under the immediate direction of Henry. As the
Emperor was ready to set his foot on land, they stepped into the water
with their drawn swords, and told him with mingled firmness and
courtesy, "that, if he came as a mediator of peace, they would receive
him with all the honours due to the imperial dignity; but if as
Emperor he challenged any sovereign power, they must tell him that the
English nation was a free people, and their King had dependence on no
monarch on earth; and they were resolved, in defence of the liberty of
the people, and the rights of their King, to oppose his landing on
their shores." The answer of the Emperor set them at ease on this
point, and he was received with every mark of respect and honour;
among other testimonies of Henry's feelings towards him, was his
installation of him as a Knight of the Garter at
Windsor.<a id="notetag156" name="notetag156"></a><a href="#note156">[156]</a></p>

<p>It is impossible not to contrast the conduct of our countrymen on this
occasion and the behaviour of Sigismund, with his conduct in France,
and the readiness with which that conduct, however humiliating, was
submitted to. Sigismund was received with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page207" name="page207">(p. 207)</a></span>
much ceremony and
magnificence at Paris; but, before he left it, he had surprised and
disgusted the King by exercising an act of sovereignty in the very
house of parliament. By courtesy he was seated on the chair usually
occupied by the King himself. A trial was proceeding, the result of
which seemed to turn on the knighthood of one of the litigants. The
Emperor called for a sword, and knighted the individual forthwith.</p>

<p>Whilst Sigismund was anxiously engaged in endeavouring to bring the
two nations to terms of peace, news arrived of an event which must
have made his efforts and mediation appear hopeless. The French had
fallen upon part of the garrison of Harfleur, and cut off a
considerable body of them. Not long after this, and whilst
negociations were pending between London and Paris, with a more
favourable appearance of a successful issue, tidings came that the
French fleet had scoured the Channel, had blockaded Southampton, and
had made various attempts on the Isle of Wight; that the Constable,
D'Armagnac, had recalled them, and they were then besieging Harfleur.
Henry and his council resolved on making an immediate and vigorous
effort to destroy that fleet; and forthwith an armament was prepared,
of which Henry expressed his determination to take the command
himself. At the urgent request, however, of the Emperor, he desisted
from that resolution, and gave the supreme command to his brother the
Duke of Bedford; who, after a most obstinate
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page208" name="page208">(p. 208)</a></span>
battle, gained
a decided victory over the enemy, and relieved
Harfleur.<a id="notetag157" name="notetag157"></a><a href="#note157">[157]</a></p>

<p>The Emperor was soon convinced that his mediation must fail, and that
France was resolved to renew the war. He then determined not to remain
neutral, but to join himself by a solemn league with Henry. The
preamble of this covenant is deeply interesting, as indicative, at
least, of the professed sentiments of Sigismund with regard to the
pretensions of Henry, and to the conduct and character of the two
belligerent kings. Sigismund declared the object of his desire to have
been the restoration of peace to the church and to Christendom; and,
with that end in view, he had endeavoured to reconcile the Kings of
England and France, but without success. The failure he ascribed
entirely to the hatred of peace which influenced the French King, to
whom he attributed also the prevalence of schism in the church, and
the disturbed state of the Christian world. He then expresses his
resolution "to form a league with Henry in the name of the Lord God of
Hosts, and to assist him in the recovery of his <span class="smcap">JUST
RIGHTS</span>."<a id="notetag158" name="notetag158"></a><a href="#note158">[158]</a>
This league was signed August 15, 1416. The Emperor,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page209" name="page209">(p. 209)</a></span>
shortly
after this unlooked-for termination of his office as mediator, left
England. Before he had proceeded onwards from Calais, Henry himself
arrived at that town. After some days, the Duke of Burgundy also
joined them; and much time was spent in secret negociations, the
nature of which did not transpire, though we may suppose both the
Emperor and King were anxious to make him a party to the league
already concluded between themselves. A covenant, however, was signed
by the Duke early in October, in which he declared that, "though he
had taken part with the enemies of Henry in time past, yet now, <i>being
assured of his lawful claim</i>, he would employ his arms in his service
as the rightful King of France."</p>

<p>The Emperor left Calais for Germany; and Henry, having concluded a
truce with France till the 2nd of February, returned to England, and
met his parliament on October 19th. Much zeal was here shown in his
behalf; and whilst the parliament granted two whole tenths and two
whole fifteenths, to be levied on the laity, the clergy gave two
tenths, to be paid by their own body. But all this was not enough;
recourse was again had to borrowing, the Dukes of Clarence, Bedford,
and Gloucester pledging themselves, in case of Henry's death, to the
repayment of the loans. Henry pawned a valuable crown to his uncle,
the Bishop of Winchester, for money to a great amount; and he pledged
very valuable jewels to the Mayor of London
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page210" name="page210">(p. 210)</a></span>
for another
large sum. No measure was left untried, that Henry might be prepared
by the ensuing spring with men and money for the invasion of
France.<a id="notetag159" name="notetag159"></a><a href="#note159">[159]</a>
In the meanwhile, the French princes and nobles who had
been taken prisoners at Agincourt were anxiously negociating for their
release. In a communication of strict confidence to the Emperor, Henry
declares that all their proceedings were suspicious, and selfish, and
deceitful; that he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page211" name="page211">(p. 211)</a></span>
had suffered the Duke of Bourbon to return
to France on certain conditions, but that the Emperor might be assured
of his resolution to invade that country.</p>


<p>Henry's exertions were effectual; and, soon after midsummer, he found
himself prepared with men and money to renew his expedition to
Normandy in a fleet of fifteen hundred sail, and with an army of not
less than twenty-five thousand soldiers. Before
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page212" name="page212">(p. 212)</a></span>
he embarked,
however, he commissioned Holland, Earl of Huntingdon, whose father had
been beheaded at Cirencester in the reign of Henry IV, with a squadron
to scour the seas, and secure a free passage for the transports. The
Earl was successful in a most hard-fought battle with a fleet of
Genoese large ships, sent by their
republic<a id="notetag160" name="notetag160"></a><a href="#note160">[160]</a>
to aid the French
King; and on July 23rd 1417, Henry set sail for the coast of
France.<a id="notetag161" name="notetag161"></a><a href="#note161">[161]</a>
A large body of French on the shore threatened to oppose
him; but he landed his forces safely, on the 1st of August, at
Beville. As soon as his people were all safe on shore, by an act
characteristic of himself, he adopted the same measure which, on his
former expedition, had compelled him to make his way to Calais by
land. He dismissed all his ships homeward, excepting what were
required for transporting cannon; thus assuring his soldiers that they
must conquer or die, for they had no retreat.</p>

<p>Henry found the country altogether deserted, the inhabitants having
fled from their homes in every direction on receiving the alarming
tidings of his approach. It is said that twenty-five thousand families
fled into Brittany; and so complete was the evacuation
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page213" name="page213">(p. 213)</a></span> in
some districts, that there reigned through the country the stillness
of death. In Lisieux, a considerable town eighteen miles from the sea,
the English found but one old man and one woman. The people had
secured themselves, to the utmost of their means, in fortified towns,
all of which had been supplied with strong garrisons on the first news
of the intended invasion.</p>

<p>Henry systematically caused the most strict discipline to be observed
in his army, of which many proofs are recorded. Among other instances
we read that when a monk complained of having been robbed by a
soldier, he was desired to fix upon the guilty man. On discovering the
culprit, the King upbraided him with his baseness, and pronounced him
worthy of death; but, on making restitution, and promising never again
to be guilty of the offence, he pardoned him. "And you, friend," said
he, turning to the monk, "go back to your brethren in peace, and
attend all of you to your sacred duties without fear of me or my army.
I am not come hither as a thief to rob your churches and altars, but
as a just and merciful King to protect you from violence." Henry then
proclaimed through the army that no one should injure an ecclesiastic
on pain of
death.<a id="notetag162" name="notetag162"></a><a href="#note162">[162]</a>
It was amusing, we are told, to see how the
numbers of the regular clergy were suddenly swollen;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page214" name="page214">(p. 214)</a></span> rustics
shaving their heads, and putting on the dress of a monk, to be safe
under the terms of that protection.</p>

<p>During this campaign Henry sent repeated bulletins of his proceedings
and successes to the mayor and aldermen of London, many of the
originals of which are still in existence; and which combine, with the
answers to them, in bearing evidence to the popularity of Henry's
person, and of the cause in which he was embarked. Some of these
documents are exceedingly interesting; but it would be needless to
transfer them all into these
pages.<a id="notetag163" name="notetag163"></a><a href="#note163">[163]</a>
It is to be lamented that
such indisputable records are not all published, or rendered
accessible to every one who would wish to consult them. The
interspersion of a few in this part of the volume may enable the
reader to verify in more points than one the views which are here
offered of Henry's character and the feeling of the people of England
at this period. The first is a letter from Henry himself, dated August
9, 1417, at Touque, the very day of the surrender of that place, and
only a week after he landed.</p>

<div class="letter">
<p> "Trusty
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page215" name="page215">(p. 215)</a></span>
and well-beloved, we greet you oftentimes well;
     doing [giving] you to understand for your comfort, that, by the
     grace of God, we be safely arrived into our land of Normandy,
     with all our subjects ordained to go with us for the first
     passage. And this day, the even of St. Lawrence, about mid-day,
     was yolden [yielded] unto us the castle of Touque, about the
     which our well-beloved cousin, the Earl of Huntingdon, lay; and
     the keys of the said castle delivered unto us without the
     shedding of Christian blood, or defence made by our enemies:&mdash;the
     which castle is an honour, and all the viscounty and lordships of
     Ange hold thereof, as we have been informed of such men as were
     therein. Whereof we thank God lowly, that hym lust [he is
     pleased] of high grace to show unto us so fair beginning in our

</div>

<p>But though Henry speaks thus encouragingly of his present campaign, he
had soon much to make him anxious, and to rouse all the energies of
his mind. Among other sources of solicitude was the growing evil of
desertion. Many of his soldiers grew tired of the war, and,
dishonourably leaving his camp, stole back to their native country. Of
the prevalence of this mischief we have too clear proof in the
following writ, a copy of which was despatched to all the sheriffs of
England. It is found
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page216" name="page216">(p. 216)</a></span>
among the Norman Rolls, and is one of
the few specimens with which Mr. Hardy has enriched the interesting
introduction to his edition of those valuable
documents.<a id="notetag164" name="notetag164"></a><a href="#note164">[164]</a></p>

<p class="letter">
     "The King to the Sheriffs of London and Middlesex, greeting.
     Whereas we have received certain information and undoubted
     evidence that divers of our lieges who lately came with us to our
     kingdom of France, there as we hoped stoutly to oppose and resist
     the pride and malice of our enemies, have deserted us in the
     midst of these our enemies, and without our licence have in great
     multitudes falsely and traitorously withdrawn and returned to our
     kingdom of England, and are still daily withdrawing and
     returning; which, if suffered to continue, would manifestly turn,
     not only to the continual prejudice of us, but to the serious
     injury and peril of our faithful lieges accompanying us (which
     God avert!) We, desirous, as we are bound, to provide and ordain

</p>

<p>The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page217" name="page217">(p. 217)</a></span>
most important siege in this campaign was that of
Caen;<a id="notetag165" name="notetag165"></a><a href="#note165">[165]</a>
at the taking of which, after a tremendous conflict and
loss of life, Henry behaved towards the vanquished with so much mercy
and kindness, that the governors of many neighbouring towns sent to
him the keys of their gates.</p>

<p>So great was his success that the French court sent commissioners to
him to negociate for peace, but the treaty resulted in no favourable
issue; and Henry went on in his career of victory through the very
depth of winter; and became master of Bayeux, Argentan, Alençon, and
other places. He was engaged, however, in the siege of Falaise through
the whole of December, the town not surrendering till the 2nd of
January.</p>

<p>It was at this time that the capture and execution of Lord Cobham took
place in England; of which we have written fully in a separate
dissertation at the close of this volume. Henry, however, probably
knew nothing of that unfortunate man's capture till he heard of his
death.</p>

<p>Early in the preceding autumn [1417] an alarm spread
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page218" name="page218">(p. 218)</a></span>
through
England in consequence of the hostile demonstration of the Scots.
There seems to be some doubt as to the extent of their movements.
Buchanan represents the whole affair as one of very little moment,
scarcely more than a border foray; but the English chroniclers lead us
to believe that it was a formidable invasion. It is said that the
Lollards were the instigators; though it is more probable that the
invitation was sent to Scotland from France, and especially through
the Duke of Orleans, then a prisoner in Pontefract, whose liberty was
consequently much straitened, as we find by an original letter of
Henry himself.<a id="notetag166" name="notetag166"></a><a href="#note166">[166]</a></p>

<p class="letter">
     "Furthermore, I would that ye commune with my brother, with the
     Chancellor, with my cousin of Northumberland, and my cousin of
     Westmorland; and that ye set a good ordinance for my north
     marches, and specially for the Duke of Orleans and for all the
     remnant of my prisoners of France, and also for the K. of
     Scotland. For as I am secretly informed by a man of right notable
     estate in this land, that there hath been a man of the Duke of
     Orleans in Scotland, and accorded with the Duke of Albany that
     this next summer he shall bring the
mammet<a id="notetag167" name="notetag167"></a><a href="#note167">[167]</a>
of Scotland to
     <span class="pagenum"><a id="page219" name="page219">(p. 219)</a></span>
stir what he may; and also that there should be found
     ways to the having away specially of the Duke of Orleans, and
     also of the K. as well as of the remnant of my said prisoners,
     that God do defend! [which God forbid!] Wherefore I will that the
     Duke of Orleans be kept still within the castle of Pomfret,
     without going to Robertis Place, or to any other disport; for it
     is better he lack his disport than we be deceived."
</p>

<p>The Scots on one side laid siege to Berwick, from which they were
driven by the Earl of Northumberland, Hotspur's son; the other part of
the Scotch army directed their attack on Roxborough, where they were
routed by the united forces of the Dukes of
Exeter<a id="notetag168" name="notetag168"></a><a href="#note168">[168]</a> and
Bedford,<a id="notetag169" name="notetag169"></a><a href="#note169">[169]</a>
and the Archbishop of York. That military prelate,
unable, from the weakness of age, to ride, yet caused himself to be
carried to the field, that surrounded by his clergy he might encourage
his people to defend their native land.</p>

<p>After these successful military proceedings in the north of the
kingdom, parliament met on Nov. 16. They prayed for speedy judgment on
rioters and malefactors; presented a petition on the subject of Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page220" name="page220">(p. 220)</a></span>
John Oldcastle; supplicated for a reward to the Lord Powys,
who was instrumental in seizing him; and then they voted the King a
subsidy of a tenth and a fifteenth. The clergy also in convocation
granted two tenths. In this convocation an attempt was made to
encourage learning by promoting to benefices such as had laboured long
and diligently in the Universities. This proposition was rejected in
Oxford at that time; but it received the cordial promotion and
assistance of the University in July 1421. On the latter occasion,
however, the measure, opposed as it was most vigorously by the monks,
would probably again have miscarried, had not Henry himself, "who
favoured arts and loved learned men," interposed his own authority in
its favour.</p>

<p>Henry<a id="notetag170" name="notetag170"></a><a href="#note170">[170]</a>
meanwhile was making rapid progress in subduing Normandy;
and to induce the inhabitants to return to their homes, which they had
abandoned, he issued a proclamation promising protection and favour to
all who would acknowledge his sovereignty. He also pledged himself to
relieve his subjects from all injustice and oppression.</p>

<p>Whilst
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page222" name="page222">(p. 222)</a></span>
he was lying before the town of Louviers, the Cardinal
des Ursins arrived in his camp with letters from the Pope, urging
Henry to make peace; the Cardinal of St. Mark having been sent to the
French King for the same purpose.</p>

<p>These offers of mediation were unavailing; and Henry, encouraged by
the distracted state of France, resolved to push his conquests to the
utmost; and, after some severe skirmishing at Pont de
Larche,<a id="notetag171" name="notetag171"></a><a href="#note171">[171]</a> he
proceeded to lay siege to Rouen. Did the plan of these Memoirs admit
of a fuller inquiry into the affairs of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page223" name="page223">(p. 223)</a></span>
France, we might here
with benefit review the proceedings of the different parties in that
country since the field of Agincourt. The result of such a review
would probably be the conviction that the divisions by which that
country was distracted not only facilitated Henry's conquests, but
alone admitted of them. His victories, even if they had ever been won,
would scarcely have followed each other so rapidly, had the King of
France, the Dauphin, and the Duke of Burgundy opposed him with united
forces.</p>

<p>The citizens of Rouen, which was well garrisoned, and had an ample
store of provisions, had declared themselves for the Duke of Burgundy;
but now, in their alarm, they supplicate aid from the Dauphin against
the common enemy. His answer was, that he was compelled to employ his
troops in defending his own towns against the Duke of
Burgundy.<a id="notetag172" name="notetag172"></a><a href="#note172">[172]</a></p>

<p>The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page224" name="page224">(p. 224)</a></span>
whole English army, with a great train of artillery, came
up before the city on the last day of July 1418, before another
harvest could afford new supplies of corn. To that one town the people
of Normandy had brought all their treasures; and those who were
intrusted with the safekeeping of the place seemed determined to
endure all the miseries of blockade and famine, rather than surrender.
Henry, with the resolution not to lavish the lives of his soldiers by
attempting to take this town by storm, laid close siege to it by land;
whilst some "good ships," which he had from the King of Portugal,
blockaded the mouth of the Seine.</p>

<p>Ten days after Henry laid siege to Rouen, he despatched a letter to
the Mayor and Aldermen of London, which, with their answer, cannot be
read without interest.</p>

<div class="letter">
<p>"<span class="smcap">BY THE KING.</span></p>

<p>"Right trusty and well-beloved! we greet you oft times well. And
     for as much as, in the name of Almighty God, and in our right,
     with his grace, we have laid the siege afore the city of Rouen,
     which is the most notable place in France, save Paris; at which
     siege, us nedeth [we need] greatly refreshing for us and for our
     host; and we have found you, our true lieges and subjects, of
     good will at all times to do all things that might do us worship
     and ease, whereof we can you right heartily thank; and pray you
     effectually that, in all the haste that ye may and ye will, do
     <span class="pagenum"><a id="page225" name="page225">(p. 225)</a></span>
arm as many small vessels as ye may goodly, with
     victuals, and namely [especially] with drink, for to come to
     Harfleur, and from thence as far as they may up the river of
     Seyne to Rouen ward with the said victual, for the refreshing of
     us and our said host, as our trust is to you; for the which
     vessels there shall be ordained sufficient conduct, with God's
     grace. Witting well also that therein ye may do us right great
     pleasance, and refreshing for all our host above said; and give
     us cause to show therefore to you ever the better lordship in
     time to come, with the help of our Saviour, the which we pray
     that He have you in his safeward.&mdash;Given under our signet, in our

<p class="left0-70">
  "To our right trusty and well-beloved the
  Mayor, Aldermen, and all the worthy
  Commoners of our city of London."</p>
</div>

<p>To this appeal the authorities of the city paid immediate and hearty
attention, and forwarded to Henry an answer under their common seal on
the 8th of September, (the Nativity of our Lady, the blissful maid,)
of which the following is a copy. A memorandum in Latin informs us
that the clause within brackets was for different causes kept back,
and not sent with the letters. The letter is a curious specimen of the
flattering and complimentary style of the good citizens of London when
addressing their sovereign.</p>

<div class="letter">
<p> "Our most dread, most sovereign Lord, and noblest King, to the

<p class="left0-70">
  "To the King, our most dread and most

</div>


<p>After
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page228" name="page228">(p. 228)</a></span>
every deduction is made from this singular epistle on
the ground of flattery and words of course, it proves that in
expression, at least, the Mayor and good citizens of London not only
heartily seconded Henry in his present undertakings, but identified
his cause with their own, and regarded him as fighting their battles,
and exposing himself to the dangers and privations of war in
vindication of their own rights; and probably we are fully justified
in regarding their sentiments as fairly representing the prevalent
feelings of the people of England. There were, doubtless, many
exceptions, as there ever must be in such a case, to the general
unanimity; and we are not without evidence that, during this siege of
Rouen, Henry's proceedings were commented upon unfavourably by some of
his subjects at
home.<a id="notetag173" name="notetag173"></a><a href="#note173">[173]</a></p>

<p>During this siege negociations were set on foot by the Dauphin for an
alliance with Henry, who seemed to enter into the views of the
ambassadors
heartily;<a id="notetag174" name="notetag174"></a><a href="#note174">[174]</a>
but at the same time similar negociations
were <span class="pagenum"><a id="page229" name="page229">(p. 229)</a></span>
carried on between Henry and the King of France. In the
management of these a curious dispute arose as to the language in
which the conference should be carried on: the French required that
their own should be the medium of communication; the English
remonstrating, and requiring the Latin to be employed, that the Pope
and other potentates might understand their proceedings. It was
proposed that all writings should be in duplicate, one copy in French,
the other in Latin; but Henry insisted that his ambassadors should
sign only an English or a Latin copy. During these negociations the
French ambassadors presented to the King the portrait of the Princess
Katharine,<a id="notetag175" name="notetag175"></a><a href="#note175">[175]</a>
which he received with great satisfaction. The treaty,
however, was broken off, and the Cardinal Des Ursins returned to Pope
Martin at Avignon. It is painful to read the account of the siege of
Rouen; misery in all its shapes is painted
there.<a id="notetag176" name="notetag176"></a><a href="#note176">[176]</a>
Indeed, if the
accounts we have received be true, so complicated a tale of
wretchedness is scarcely upon record. But the details can give no
satisfaction; they would only harrow up the feelings, without
supplying any facts essential
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page230" name="page230">(p. 230)</a></span>
to the history of those months
of human suffering. Henry was resolved neither to burn the town, nor
to take it by storm; but to reduce it by starvation. At length his
feelings overpowered this resolution, and he received the town upon
conditions, on the 19th January
1419.<a id="notetag177" name="notetag177"></a><a href="#note177">[177]</a>
Thus was Rouen subdued to
the Crown of England, two hundred and fifteen years after the conquest
of it by Philip of France in the reign of King John. Stowe tells us,
that to relieve this oppressed city Henry ordained it to be the chief
chamber of all Normandy; and directed his exchequer, his treasury, and
his coinage to be kept there. We have already seen that he caused his
vast treasures before kept in Harfleur to be brought to Rouen.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>It is confessedly beyond the province of these Memoirs even to glance
at the affairs of Ireland, except so far as a reference to them may
bear upon the character and conduct of Henry of Monmouth. Not only,
however, does the presence of a body of native
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page231" name="page231">(p. 231)</a></span>
Irish, headed
by one of the regular clergy of Ireland, aiding Henry at the siege of
Rouen, seem to draw our thoughts thitherward; but some documents also,
relative to our sister-land, of that date, may be thought to require a
few words in this place. During the reign of Richard II. the warlike
movements of the native Irish, who had never been conquered or
civilized, compelled that monarch to proceed to Ireland in person, and
to take the field against those wild rebels. They had formerly been
kept in comparative awe by a strong hand; but the continental wars of
Edward III. had much slackened the wonted vigilance and activity of
his government at home in checking their outbreakings against the
English settlers. They had, consequently, grown bold, and threatened
to extirpate the English altogether. Vigorous measures became
necessary, and the King twice headed an army himself to restore peace.
On his first visit he was summoned home by the prelates, to put down
the spreading sect of the Lollards; in his second, his delay, after
the landing of Bolinbroke at Ravenspurg, cost him his crown. In this
latter expedition Henry of Monmouth (as we have seen) accompanied him,
and had personal experience of the uncivilized state of the country,
and the savage character of the warfare carried on by the inhabitants.
It is curious to remark, that on several occasions Richard II.
employed the Irish prelates as his ambassadors to Rome, "for the safe
estate and prosperity of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page232" name="page232">(p. 232)</a></span>
the most holy English church." The
fact, however, is too evident, that all Irish dignities were bestowed
on Englishmen; and except by some assumed privilege of the Pope, or by
other proceedings equally unacceptable to the English settlers, no
native Irishman was ever in those times advanced to any high station
in the church, or even promoted to an ordinary benefice. Indeed the
law forbade such promotions.</p>

<p>On the principle observed throughout these Memoirs, of avoiding all
reference to the political struggles and controversies of the passing
hour, the Author will make no reflections on the past, the present, or
the future policy of England towards a country whose destinies seem so
indissolubly bound up with her own. He humbly prays that HE, who says
to the tempest "Peace, be still!" and is obeyed, may so guide and
govern the religious and moral storms by which our age is shaken on
the subject of Ireland, that in His own good time the troubled
elements may be calmed; and that truth, peace, and charity may
prevail, and bless both countries, then at length become like "a city
that is at unity in itself."</p>

<p>By most of those who take a wide and comprehensive range of its
history, the dissensions which have distracted Ireland, and from time
to time torn it in pieces, and caused it to flow with the blood of its
neighbours and of its own children, will probably be ascribed, not
more to the difference of religion among
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page233" name="page233">(p. 233)</a></span>
its inhabitants,
than to the difference of origin. The struggles have been, not more
between Protestants and Romanists, not more between Catholics of the
church of England and Ireland, and Catholics in communion with the
sovereign pontiff, than between English and Irish, between those who
have regarded themselves as the aboriginal sons of the soil, and those
of Saxon or Norman descent, whom they have hated and abhorred as
intruders and invaders. The conflicts between these classes in
Ireland, as they may be traced in its chronicles, were just as
dreadful and as sanguinary before the Reformation, as ever they have
been since the separation of the reformed church from the see of Rome.
At all events, whatever may be the nature of the unhappy causes of
disunion in the present day, till within comparatively modern times
the struggles have been not more of a religious than of a national, or
perhaps of a predial, character. Authentic history teems with evidence
bearing directly on this point; and even the original documents,
references to which are interspersed through this volume, are quite
sufficient to establish it.</p>

<p>Among other documents confirmatory of the view here taken, which it
would be beyond the province of these Memoirs to recite, the statute
of 4 Hen. V. (1416), referring as it does to similar enactments of
previous reigns, and strongly expressive of the bitter jealousies
which existed between the two nations, seems to claim a place here.</p>

<p class="letter">
     "Whereas
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page234" name="page234">(p. 234)</a></span>
it was ordained in the times of the progenitors
     of our Lord the King, by statute made in the land of Ireland,
     that no one of the Irish nation be elected archbishop, bishop,
     abbot, prior, nor in any manner be received or accepted to any
     dignity or benefice within the said land; and whereas many such
     Irish, by the power of certain letters of licence to them made by
     the Lieutenants of the King there to accept and receive such
     dignities and benefices, are promoted and advanced to
     archbishoprics and bishoprics within the said land, who also have
     made their collations to Irish clerks of dignities and benefices
     there, contrary to the form and effect of the said statute; and
     consequently, since they are peers of parliament in that land,
     they bring with them to the parliaments and councils held in that
     land servants by whom the secrets of the English in that land
     have been and are from day to day discovered to the Irish people
     who are rebels against the King, to the great peril and mischief
     of the King's loyal subjects in that land: our said Lord the
     King, willing to provide remedy for his faithful subjects, with
     the consent of the Lords, and at the request of the Commons,
     wills and grants that the said statute shall be in full force,
     and be well and duly guarded, and fully executed, on pain of his
     grievous indignation."
</p>

<p>The statute then provides, that if any bishops act against this law,
their temporalities shall be seized for the King till they have given
satisfaction; that the Lieutenants shall be prohibited from granting
such licences to Irishmen; and that all such licences, if made, shall
be null and void.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, the words of the petition to the Commons, on which
this enactment was founded, are still more striking and convincing on
the subject.</p>

<p class="letter">
     "To
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page235" name="page235">(p. 235)</a></span>
the honourable and wise Sires, the Commons of this
     present Parliament, the poor loyal liegemen of our Sovereign Lord
     the King in Ireland. Whereas the said land is divided between two
     nations, that is to say, the said petitioners, English and of the
     English nation, and the Irish nation, those enemies to our Lord
     the King, who by crafty designs secretly, and by open destruction
     making war, are continually purposed to destroy the said lieges,
     and to conquer the land, the petitioners pray that remedy thereof
     be made."<a id="notetag178" name="notetag178"></a><a href="#note178">[178]</a>
</p>

<p>When Henry of Monmouth succeeded to the throne, Ireland was as
wild<a id="notetag179" name="notetag179"></a><a href="#note179">[179]</a>
in its country, and as rude in its inhabitants, as it was in
the reign of Henry II. The English pale (as it has been correctly
said) was little more than a garrison of territory; and it was
absolutely necessary either for the English inhabitants to leave their
possessions and abandon Ireland altogether, or for the English
government to keep the aboriginal Irish in check with a strong hand,
and compel them by military force to abstain from outrage. What would
have been at the present day the state of Ireland, had Henry directed
his concentrated energies to subdue the island, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page236" name="page236">(p. 236)</a></span>
then to
civilize and improve it, (measures by no means improbable had not the
conquest of France occupied him instead,) it would be profitless to
speculate. Even with his thoughts distracted by his foreign
expeditions, or rather, perhaps, almost absorbed by them, and whilst
he had but a very scanty contingent of officers and men at his
disposal for home-service, we have evidence that Ireland had not been
in so peaceable a condition for very many years as it had become under
his government. Whilst pursuing his victories on the Continent, he
laboured (and his labours were in an astonishing degree successful) to
provide for the effective administration of his own dominions with a
view to peace and justice.</p>

<p>A memorial forwarded this year to Henry, probably in consequence of
certain complaints of maladministration which had been sent to the
council the preceding winter, is very interesting. It is signed by a
large number of persons, lay and ecclesiastical: bishops, abbots,
priors, archdeacons, barons, knights, and esquires joined in the
petition.<a id="notetag180" name="notetag180"></a><a href="#note180">[180]</a>
The prayer of the memorial was professedly to procure a
fuller remuneration to the then Lord
Lieutenant,<a id="notetag181" name="notetag181"></a><a href="#note181">[181]</a>
John Talbot,
Lord Furnival, for his indefatigable and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page237" name="page237">(p. 237)</a></span>
successful
exertions in subduing "the English rebels and the Irish enemies;" it
was, however, evidently intended to obtain a still greater share of
the King's attention, and of the public expenditure in that island.
The memorial commences by expressions of loyalty to Henry's person,
the petitioners desiring above all earthly things to hear and to know
of the gracious prosperity and noble health of his renowned person, to
the principal comfort of all his subjects, but "especially of us who
are continuing in a land of war, environed by your Irish enemies and
English rebels, in point to be destroyed, if it were not that the
sovereign aid and comfort of God, and of you our gracious Lord, do
deliver us." It then states that they had prevailed upon the
Lieutenant<a id="notetag182" name="notetag182"></a><a href="#note182">[182]</a>
not to persevere in his intention to leave Ireland for
the purpose of applying to Henry
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page238" name="page238">(p. 238)</a></span>
in person for payment and
relief, expressing their great alarm should his presence be withdrawn
from them. The memorialists then dwell at great length upon the vast
labours, travails, and endeavours of Lord Furnival for the good of all
Henry's lieges; but those labours were only military proceedings:
every sentence of the memorial breathes of war, and slaughter, and
destruction. One of the chief topics in his praise is that he remained
many days and nights ("the which was not done before in our time") in
the lands of various of the strongest Irish enemies (specifying them
by name), taking their chief places and goods, burning, foraging, and
destroying all the country, and in many places causing the Irish
rebels to turn their weapons against each other. The document then
shows the precarious tenure of goods and of life among the English at
that time in Ireland; how they were "preyed upon and killed," and what
a wonderful change had just been effected by the vigorous measures of
Lord Furnival. "Now your lieges may suffer their goods and cattle to
remain in the fields day and night, without being stolen or sustaining
any loss, <i>which hath not been seen here by the space of these thirty
years past</i>, God be thanked, and your gracious provision!" It also
states that Maurice O'Keating, chieftain of his nation, traitor and
rebel, did on the Monday in Whitsun-week, (<i>i.e.</i> May 31st, not a
month before the date of the memorial,) "for the great fear which he
had of the Lieutenant, for himself and his nation, yield
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page239" name="page239">(p. 239)</a></span>
himself without any condition, with his breast against his sword's
point, and a cord about his neck, delivering without ransom the
English prisoners which he had taken before; to whom grace was granted
by indenture, and his eldest son given in pledge to be loyal lieges
from henceforward to you our sovereign Lord." This memorial, dated
June 26th, "in the fifth year of your gracious reign," 1417, must have
reached Henry on the very eve of his setting out on his second
expedition to Normandy.</p>

<p>The complaints, to answer which, among other objects, we have already
intimated an opinion that this memorial might possibly have been
partly prepared, were taken into consideration on the 28th of the
preceding February by the King himself in council, and are by no means
devoid of interest, though only a cursory allusion to them can be made
here. Among the grievances are certain "impositions outrageously
imposed upon them;" the seizure of the wheat and cattle belonging to
churchmen by the officers and soldiers of the Lieutenant, contrary to
the liberties of Holy Church; and the non-execution and non-observance
of the laws in consequence of the insufficiency of the officers. To
these complaints the King replies that, at the expiration of Lord
Furnival's lieutenancy, he would provide a remedy by the appointment
of good and sufficient officers. The terms of indenture, by which the
King and Lieutenant were then usually bound,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page240" name="page240">(p. 240)</a></span>
probably
presented an obstacle to any immediate interference.</p>

<p>But the most interesting point in these complaints is the prayer with
which they close. It proves that, in the view of the complainants,
(and probably theirs was the general opinion,) absenteeism was then
very prevalent, and was held to be one of the greatest evils under
which Ireland was at that time suffering; it informs us also that
Irishmen born (that is, however, men of English extraction born in
Ireland,) were advanced to benefices in England; and it shows that
many such natives of Ireland were in the habit of coming to England
for the purposes of studying the law, and of residing in the
Universities. The complainants "require that through the realm of
England proclamation be made that all persons born in Ireland, being
in England, except persons of the church beneficed, and students and
others engaged in the departments of the law, and scholars studying in
the Universities, betake themselves to the parts of Ireland, for
defence of the same.</p>

<p>To this petition the King only replies, that "he grants it according
to the form of the statute made in that case."</p>

<p>The statute to which Henry here refers was made in the first year of
his reign. It bears incidental testimony to his mild and merciful
disposition, as compared with the feelings and views of his
contemporaries; and shows that in legislation he took
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page241" name="page241">(p. 241)</a></span>
the
lead of his parliament in preferring mild and moderate to violent and
sanguinary measures.</p>

<p>The Commons pray that the penalty of absenteeism after the
proclamation should be loss of life or limb, and forfeiture of goods;
the King consents only to imprisonment, instead of death and
mutilation. "The Commons," (such are the words of the record,) "for
the quiet and peace of the realm of England, and for the increase and
welfare of the land of Ireland, pray that it may be ordained in the
present parliament, that all Irishmen, and all Irish begging clerks,
called Chaumber Deakyns [chamberdeacons], be voided the realm between
Michaelmas and All Saints, on pain of loss of life and limb; except
such as are graduates in the schools, and serjeants and students of
law, and such as have inheritance in England, and 'professed
religious;' and that all the Irish who have benefices and office in
Ireland live on their benefices and offices, on pain of losing the
profits of their benefices and offices,&mdash;for the protection of the
land of Ireland." The King grants the prayer, but modifies the
severity of the penalty proposed by the Commons, limiting the
punishment to the loss of goods, and imprisonment during the royal
pleasure; and excepting merchants born in Ireland of good fame, and
their apprentices, now being in England, and those to whom the King
may grant a dispensation.</p>

<p>It was in the year following these proceedings that Henry received
succours from Ireland, just before
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page242" name="page242">(p. 242)</a></span>
he laid siege to Rouen.
The Pell Rolls state that they were two hundred horse and three
hundred foot, under the command of the Prior of
Kilmaynham,<a id="notetag183" name="notetag183"></a><a href="#note183">[183]</a>
transported by Bristol vessels from Waterford to France. Others,
doubtless, might have joined him also from the same quarter; but it
seems very probable that Hall, or those whom he followed, exaggerated
this statement, and substituted the Lord of Kylmaine for the Prior of
Kilmaynham, when they tell us "that a band of one thousand six hundred
native Irish, armed with their own weapons of war, in mail, with darts
and skaynes, under the Lord of Kylmaine, were with Henry V. at the
siege of Rouen, and kept the way from the forest of Lyons; and so did
their devoir that none were more praised, nor did more damage to their
enemies." Still the account given of these wild Irish, by Monstrelet,
would seem to countenance the idea of a much greater number than were
transported over with the warlike Prior. "The King of England" (says
that author) "had with him in his company a vast number of Irish, of
whom far the greatest part went on foot. One of their feet was
covered, the other was naked, without having clouts, and poorly clad.
Each had a target and little javelins,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page243" name="page243">(p. 243)</a></span>
with large knives of
a strange fashion. And those who were mounted had no saddles, but they
rode very adroitly on their little mountain horses: and they rode upon
cloths, very nearly of the same fashion with those which the Blatiers
of the French country carry. They were, however, a very poor and
slight defence, compared with the English: besides, they were not so
accoutred as to do much damage to the French when they met. These
Irish would often, during the siege, together with the English, scour
the country of Normandy, and do infinite mischief, beyond calculation;
carrying back to their host great booty. Moreover, the said Irish on
foot would seize little children, and leap on the backs of cows with
them, carrying the children before them on the cows, and very often
they were found in that condition by the
French."<a id="notetag184" name="notetag184"></a><a href="#note184">[184]</a></p>

<p>The only other document relating to Ireland at this time, which it is
purposed to transfer into these pages, is chiefly interesting as
affording one of the many instances upon record of the personal
attention which Henry paid to the business necessary to be transacted
at home, whilst he was engaged in battles and sieges and victories
abroad. It is a petition, (in itself also of some importance in regard
to Irish history,) from Donald Macmurough, (Macmore or Macmurcoo,)
addressed to "the most high and excellent redoubted Lord the King of
England," and is dated July 24, 1421.</p>

<div class="letter">
<p>"Most
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page244" name="page244">(p. 244)</a></span>
humbly supplicates, Donaal Macmurcoo, a prisoner
     in your Tower of London, that as above all things in the world,
     (most gracious Lord,) with entire intent of his heart, he desires
     to be your liege man, and to behave towards you from this day
     forward in good faith, as is his right; and to do that loyally he
     offers to be bound by the faith of his body [his corporal oath],
     and all the sacraments of Holy Church, in any manner which you
     please graciously to ordain and appoint; and all his friends who
     are at his will, under his subjection, or at his command under
     his lordships, will promise the same by word of mouth. And for
     greater security for the time to come, as well to your most noble
     and sovereign Lordship as to your heirs and the crown of England,
     during his life loyally to hold and accomplish the same, he
     offers you his son and heir in pledge. May it please your most
     high and gracious excellence, according to his promises
     aforesaid, graciously to receive and accept him to your most
     noble and abundant grace, for God's sake and in a work of
     charity."</p>

<p>The petition is in French.&mdash;The answer in English is this: "Ye
     King will that he come before his counsel, and find surety as it
     may be found reasonable."</p>

<p> "For Macmourgh.&mdash;Offer to be sworn to the King, and to give
     hostage thereupon."</p>
</div>

<p>The order of the council consequent upon this, in Latin, refers the
matter to the Lieutenant and council in Ireland.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>Henry at this time appears to have had considerable intercourse with
the see of Rome. In a letter written to his resident ambassador in
that city, John Keterich, Bishop of Lichfield, he requires, in very
humble language, that his Holiness would not invade the rights of the
crown of England as settled
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page245" name="page245">(p. 245)</a></span>
by a concordat between Edward
III. and Gregory XI; that he would provide for the admission of
Englishmen only into the priories in England which the Conqueror had
annexed to Norman abbeys; and that he would send strict injunctions to
the bishops of Ireland that the people should be taught the English
tongue, and that none should be capable of any ecclesiastical
preferment who should be ignorant of it, since the best and greatest
part of that nation understood it, and experience had shown what
disorders and confusions arose from a diversity of languages.</p>

<p>It is impossible to read the documents of this time without being
struck by the evidence as well of the thraldom under which the Pope
held the sovereigns and people of Christendom, as of the spirit of
piety which habitually influenced Henry.</p>

<p>His confessor had died, and he had applied to the Archbishop of
Canterbury to select another for him. That primate's answer is full of
interest. The Archbishop gives the King all the authority which he
himself possessed; and yet Henry is obliged to seek permission at the
court of Rome to have a confessor of his own, and to celebrate divine
service at convenient times and in convenient places. He had sent for
a chapel, with altars, vestments, and ministers, from England; and the
warrant is in existence to press carriages and horses to carry them to
the sea, to be transported to him in Normandy. This instrument is
dated February
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page246" name="page246">(p. 246)</a></span>
5th, 1418, and it should seem that all these
preparations were insufficient till he could obtain the Pope's licence
and dispensation in the following
August.<a id="notetag185" name="notetag185"></a><a href="#note185">[185]</a></p>

<p>The Pope then gives Henry permission to have a confessor of his own
choice, who should once a year during his life, and once also at the
hour of death, give him full pardon for all the sins of which he
repented from the heart, and which he confessed with the mouth;
provided that the confessor take care to have satisfaction given to
those to whom it is due. The Pope adds an earnest hope that this
indulgence would not tempt Henry to commit unlawful acts at all more
freely than
before.<a id="notetag186" name="notetag186"></a><a href="#note186">[186]</a></p>

<p>By another act of grace, dated only ten days after the former, King
Henry is permitted to have one or more portable altars, and to have
mass at uncanonical times, and even in prohibited places, provided he
were not himself the cause of the interdict. This grant has also some
curious stipulations annexed: among others it is directed that the
doors shall be shut at such masses, the excommunicated excluded, the
service being conducted without sound of bell and with a low voice.
Especially is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page247" name="page247">(p. 247)</a></span>
it enjoined that liberty to have mass before
day should be used very sparingly, because since our Lord Jesus
Christ, the Son of God, is offered as a sacrifice on that altar,&mdash;and
he is the brightness of eternal light,&mdash;it is right for that to be
done, not in the darkness of night, but in the light of day.</p>

<p>Henry remained for some time at Rouen, and wore the ducal robes as
Duke of Normandy. A conspiracy to surrender the town to the French
King was defeated by the honourable conduct of De Bouteiller, who, on
being requested to join the conspirators, on the contrary discovered
their designs to Henry.</p>

<p>Early in the year 1419, the Duke of Brittany, distrusting the power of
France to defend him, were the English to turn their arms against his
territory, sought and obtained an alliance with Henry; of whose just
and honourable principles he had experienced practical proofs.</p>

<p>At this time the Spaniards added much to Henry's difficulties. Having
engaged to succour the Dauphin, they are said to have sent ships to
Scotland for men, part of whom they probably landed at Rochelle.
Henry's forces, however, were victorious in the south, no less than in
the north.</p>

<p>Still, though victorious and feared on every side, Henry found that
war and disease had so reduced his army as to compel him to apply to
his subjects at home for reinforcement. The reasons sent from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page248" name="page248">(p. 248)</a></span>
Norfolk, which are probably only specimens of the returns from
other counties, would lead us to infer that most of his subjects, who
were both willing and able to join his standard, had already been
drained off. The Bishop of Norwich, and others, return that "the
stoutest and strongest of their countrymen were already in the army,
and others pleaded poverty and infirmities." Robert Waterton, to whom
the King had made an especial appeal, assured him that at the
approaching assizes at York he would urge the gentlemen of those parts
to tender their services. There seems also to have been a growing
disinclination or disability among the clergy to provide a supply of
money; probably both their means and their zeal for the cause had
diminished. In the diocese of York they complained loudly of the
impoverished state of the church, but at last voted one-half of a
tenth.</p>

1419-1420.</h3>


<p>About the month of March in the year 1419, the Dauphin proposed to
meet Henry with a view to the formation of an alliance, to which Henry
was at this time by no means averse. The Dauphin, however, acted with
very bad faith on the occasion; and, by neglecting to come according
to his solemn
engagement,<a id="notetag187" name="notetag187"></a><a href="#note187">[187]</a>
gave unintentionally another opening to
the Duke of Burgundy to advocate a treaty between France and England.
So utterly, indeed, had the Dauphin thrown aside all thoughts of an
interview
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page250" name="page250">(p. 250)</a></span>
with Henry, on which he had appeared very anxiously
bent, that he even made a vigorous attack on the English ambassadors
and their escort when on their road to the King of France.</p>

<p>The Duke of Burgundy, taking advantage of this juncture, succeeded,
not only in persuading the two Kings to interchange ambassadors, but
in effecting a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page251" name="page251">(p. 251)</a></span>
personal conference between the royal
parties. Henry agreed to come to Mante, on condition that Charles and
the Duke of Burgundy would come to Ponthoise. A large field on the
banks of the Seine, near to the gate of Melun, was selected for the
meeting. The preparations for the interview are described with great
minuteness by historians. A pavilion at an equal distance from the
tents of both nations was erected by the Queen of France, and
presented to Henry; adjoining to it were two withdrawing apartments.
The King of France was detained by indisposition at Ponthoise on the
day appointed, May 30, 1419; but the Queen, the Princess, the Duke of
Burgundy, and the Count de St. Pol, on the one side, with their
council and guards, and, on the other, Henry, his two brothers,
Clarence and Gloucester, his two uncles, the Duke of Exeter and the
Bishop of Winchester, the Earls of March and Salisbury, with his
council and his guard, met in this "fair and wide mead of Melun." The
Queen's tent was "a fair pavilion of blue velvet richly embroidered
with flower-de-luces; and on the top was the figure of a flying hart,
in silver, with wings enamelled." Henry's tent was of blue and green
velvet, with the figures of two antelopes embroidered; one drawing in
a mill, the other seated on high with a branch of olive in his mouth,
with this motto wrought in several places, "After busy labour, comes
victorious rest." A great eagle of gold, with eyes of diamond, was
placed above. At
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page252" name="page252">(p. 252)</a></span>
three in the afternoon the royal parties,
having entered within the barriers, approached each other, the Queen
led by the Duke of Burgundy, the Princess by the Count de St. Pol.
Henry with a solemn bow took the Queen by the hand and saluted her,
and afterwards the Princess; as did also his brothers, bending one
knee almost to the ground. The Duke of Burgundy paid his respects to
Henry, and was honourably received by him. Henry led the Queen into
the pavilion, taking the upper hand of her after a long dispute about
this ceremony; and having placed her in one chair of state, of cloth
of gold, himself occupied the other. Nothing further than ceremony was
the apparent object of that day's conference, though the fate of Henry
perhaps turned upon it. The Earl of Warwick, "the father of courtesy,"
addressed the Queen, and the parties separated,&mdash;the Queen's for
Ponthoise, Henry's for Mante; having first engaged to meet each other
again on the following Thursday. These conferences were carried on at
intervals till June 30th, without any satisfactory progress being made
towards peace; on that day they agreed to meet on the 3rd July, and
Henry kept his engagement, but the French disappointed him; and then,
convinced of their insincerity, and the total absence of all real
intentions on their part to bring the proceedings to a favourable
issue, he dissolved the conference, complaining loudly of the unfair
dealings of his enemies. He was chiefly, however, angry with the Duke
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page253" name="page253">(p. 253)</a></span>
of Burgundy, to whom he ascribed all the blame; and who is
said to have been guilty of such double-dealing as to have had
frequent interviews with the Dauphin in the neighbourhood of Paris,
even during the conference.</p>

<p>A circumstance connected with this meeting is too closely interwoven
with Henry's character, and conduct, and destiny, to be passed over in
silence. In preparing for the interview, the Queen had shown much
courteous attention to secure Henry's gratification; and she looked
forward to it as the hour of her daughter
Katharine's<a id="notetag188" name="notetag188"></a><a href="#note188">[188]</a>
conquest
over his heart. That Princess was a lovely young person, and in the
very prime and bloom of her beauty; and her mother had flattered
herself that her charms would prevail over the young conqueror more
than the arms or the statesmen of France. Nor had the designing lady
altogether miscalculated the power of her daughter's charms, or the
extent of Henry's susceptibility. His heart was touched at the first
sight of Katharine, and the practised eyes of her mother saw that the
victory was won. Her daughter (she observed) had overcome a prince who
appeared till then invincible. But
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page254" name="page254">(p. 254)</a></span>
the wily Queen outwitted
herself; and, for the present, by her own act disengaged the toils in
which Henry had been unquestionably taken. With a view of inflaming
his love for her daughter the more by her absence, and of compelling
him to comply with any conditions of a treaty, one of which would be
Katharine's hand and heart, she would not suffer the Princess to be
present at any of the following interviews: the first sight of so much
beauty had so triumphant an effect, that she would not permit a
second. But her scheme, however finely drawn, was observed by Henry;
and, indignant at the artifice, he became more inflexible than ever,
and insisted more firmly than before on his first proposals; assuring
the Duke of Burgundy that he was resolved to have the Princess with
all his other demands, or force the King of France from his throne,
and drive the Duke from the kingdom.</p>

<p>The unsuccessful issue of this famous conference was undoubtedly owing
in some measure to the Duke of Burgundy, who was for a long time
balancing in his mind the policy of joining Henry or the Dauphin.
Henry openly charged the Duke with dishonourable conduct; and then the
Duke, in a conference at
Melun,<a id="notetag189" name="notetag189"></a><a href="#note189">[189]</a>
on Tuesday, July 11th, 1419, made
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page255" name="page255">(p. 255)</a></span>
a solemn league, offensive and defensive, with the Dauphin.
They engaged to join in the administration of the government without
jealousy and envy; and after mutual acts of courtesy, and ratifying
the covenant of peace by solemn oaths, they parted, professedly sworn
friends, but having war against each other in their hearts.</p>

<p>Henry, after the respite of these abortive negociations, again entered
upon his career of war and conquest. The next fortified town was
Ponthoise, possession of which would open his way to Paris. His
soldiers were in the highest spirits; and he seems himself, so far
from being dismayed by the union of the Duke of Burgundy with the
French court, to have been roused by a sense of his difficulties and
dangers to a still higher spirit of valour and enterprise. Ponthoise
was taken by surprise, and Henry regarded it as the most important
place he had taken during the war. How resolved soever he was to be
master of it, he would not make the attempt till after the expiration
of the truce with the Duke of Burgundy, "so punctual was he to the
observance of his faith and honour, which in brave princes are
inviolable." And, to use the words of Goodwin, "his soul was so little
altered from its natural moderation by this success, that he sent to
the King of France to tell him, that though he had taken so
considerable a town, which, being only a few leagues from Paris,
opened a way to the conquest of that capital, yet he now offered him
peace
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page256" name="page256">(p. 256)</a></span>
upon the same terms which he had propounded in the
treaty of Melun; with this only addition, that Ponthoise also should
now be confirmed to him."</p>

<p>The Dauphin's troops diminished the joy of this victory by taking one
or two places by surprise. Still all Paris was in great consternation,
and the panic ran through the Isle of France; whilst Clarence marched
his troops to the very walls of the metropolis. Shortly after the fall
of Ponthoise Henry despatched letters to the citizens of London; which
were intercepted by the enemy, who took the bearer of them prisoner.
He consequently sent another despatch to the same purport, from Trie
Le Chastel, near Gisors, on the 12th of the next month. The importance
he attached to this communication, his repetition of the intercepted
letters clearly intimates: it is chiefly interesting now because it
assures us that Henry believed himself to be almost within reach of
the objects of his enterprise; whilst it acquaints us also with the
fact, that he had applied for aid to all his friends through
Christendom. The letter, it is believed, has never yet been published.</p>

     when they hear of the arming and the array that ye and other of
     our subjects make at home in help of us, shall give them great
     courage to haste their coming unto us much the rather, and not

     do (as we trust into you at this time), ye might never have done
     into us since our wars in France began. For we trust fully to
     God's might and his mercy, with good help of your aid and of our
     land, to have a good end of our said war in short time, and for
     to come home unto you to great comfort and singular joy of our
     heart, as God knoweth: the which He grant us to his pleasance,
     and have you ever in his keeping! Given under our signet in our
     town of Pontoise, the 17th day of August.</p>

     departed from us at Pontoise our letters to you direct in the
     same tenour; and because it is said the bearer of them is by our
     enemies taken into Crotey, we renouelle [renew] them here at Trye

<p>Henry's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page258" name="page258">(p. 258)</a></span>
arms were victorious through this autumn, town after
town, and fortress after fortress, yielding to him; when an event took
place which had a most decided and immediate influence on his affairs
and those of
France.<a id="notetag190" name="notetag190"></a><a href="#note190">[190]</a>
The Dauphin solicited another interview with
the Duke of Burgundy, who was cautioned by some of his friends against
trusting his person again to that prince's power; whilst others
deprecated the appearance in the Duke of any suspicion of the
Dauphin's faith and honour. The Duke proceeded to Montereau; where, on
the bridge which led to the town, a room of wood-work was prepared for
the conference; and at the end, towards the town, were successive
barriers. These excited suspicion; still the Duke quitted the town,
and entered into the place appointed. There he met the Dauphin, who
was surrounded by assassins ready to despatch his enemy at a
word.<a id="notetag191" name="notetag191"></a><a href="#note191">[191]</a>
Never was a more base and foul murder committed than that
by which the Duke
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page259" name="page259">(p. 259)</a></span>
of Burgundy was butchered on the bridge of
Montereau. His own guilt is no justification of his murderers; and it
is an unsafe interpretation of the inscrutable acts of Providence to
regard his death "as the requital of divine
justice."<a id="notetag192" name="notetag192"></a><a href="#note192">[192]</a>
He had
caused the Duke of Orleans to be assassinated in the streets of Paris,
and he now falls himself by the murderous hands of assassins. He was a
bold, presumptuous, ambitious, and licentious man; and his own vices
betrayed him to his ruin. But those by whom he fell were equally
guilty of treachery and murder, as though he had through his life been
guiltless of blood, and an example of virtue.</p>

<p>This tragedy filled the people of France with affliction for the
murdered Duke, and with horror at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page260" name="page260">(p. 260)</a></span>
the Dauphin's perfidy and
cruelty; but no one seemed to be rendered more decidedly hostile to
him for this act than his own mother and father. And whilst the son of
the murdered Duke swore he would never lay down his arms till he had
avenged his father's death upon his murderers, the King himself, by a
proclamation dated Troyes, January 27, 1420, declared that Charles,
Count of Ponthieu, condemned and cursed by God, by nature, and his own
parents, could have no title to the throne; and that it was just and
expedient, for the peace of the nation, that Henry, King of England,
should be established Regent of France.</p>

<p>Henry at this time seems to have been exceedingly apprehensive lest,
by the escape of the princes and nobles of France, his prisoners in
England, the prospect of securing his conquests by a treaty of peace
might be interrupted. An original letter, addressed by him to his
Chancellor, dated Gisors, October 1, 1419, acquaints us with his
anxiety on this subject; whilst it affords another interesting
specimen of the English language at that time, and Henry's own style.</p>

1419-1420.</h3>


<p>One of the most strikingly characteristic features of the
extraordinary hero, whose life and character we are endeavouring to
elucidate, forces itself especially upon our notice during his
campaigns in Normandy. Neither the flush of victory, nor the
disappointments and anxiety of a protracted siege, neither the
multiplied and distracting cares of intricate negociations, nor the
incessant trials of personal
fatigue,<a id="notetag194" name="notetag194"></a><a href="#note194">[194]</a>
could withdraw his mind
from what might
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page263" name="page263">(p. 263)</a></span>
perhaps be not unfitly called the private
duties of his high
station.<a id="notetag195" name="notetag195"></a><a href="#note195">[195]</a>
If an act of injustice was made known
to him, he could not rest till he had punished the guilty party, and
compelled them to make restitution. If abuses in church or state came
under his eye, (and his eye was never closed against them,) he would
himself personally provide for the necessary reform. If disputes
threatened the peace and welfare of a community over which he had any
control, he delighted to act as mediator and to restore peace. And all
this he did in the midst
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page264" name="page264">(p. 264)</a></span>
of the noise, and confusion, and
ceaseless disturbances of a camp in the heart of an enemy's country,
with the same anxious zeal, and attention to details, as he could have
shown in the times of profoundest peace; though now and then dropping
an expression to make his correspondent understand how much more time
and thought he would have devoted to the subject before them, were not
his mind and body so occupied by war.</p>

<p>Among many illustrations of this striking trait in Henry's character,
the following instances will, it is presumed, be deemed generally
interesting, and deserving a fuller notice than a brief statement of
the facts might require.</p>

<p>The first is a letter from Henry to his brother the Duke of Bedford,
then Guardian of England, in which he urges him to attend without
delay to some complaints from the subjects of the Duke of Brittany,
and to take prompt and efficient measures to prevent a repetition of
the injuries complained of.</p>

<div class="letter">
<p> "<span class="smcap">By the King</span>.</p>

<p> "Right trusty and well-beloved brother, we greet you as well. And
     as we suppose it is not out of your remembrance in what wise and
     how oft we have charged you by our letters that good and hasty
     reparation and restitution were ordained and made at all times of
     such attemptats as happened to be made by our subjects against
     the truce taken betwixt us and our brother, the Duke of Brittany;
     and, notwithstanding our said letters, diverse complaints be made
     and sent unto us for default of reparation and restitution of
     <span class="pagenum"><a id="page265" name="page265">(p. 265)</a></span>
such attemptats as be made by certain of our subjects
     and lieges, as ye may understand by a supplication sent to us by
     the said Duke; which supplication we send you closed within these
     letters, for to have the more plain knowledge of the truth.
     Wherefore we will and charge you that ye call to you our
     chancellor, to have knowledge of the same supplication; and, that
     done, we will that ye do send us in all haste all those persons
     that been our subjects contained in the supplication aforesaid.
     And that also in all other semblable matters ye do ordain so
     hasty and just remedy, restitution, and reparation upon such
     attemptats done by our subjects, in conservation of our truce,
     that no man have cause hereafter to complain in such wise as they
     [have] done for default of right doing; nor we cause to write to
     you alway as we done for such causes, <i>considered the great
     occupation we have otherwise</i>. And God have you in his
     keeping!&mdash;Given under our signet, in our host afore Rouen, the

<p>The next instance

on the apprehension entertained of
intended violence and general disturbance of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page266" name="page266">(p. 266)</a></span>
the public peace
near Bourdeaux by two noblemen who disputed about the property of a
deceased lord. Henry's letter is addressed to the Council of
Bourdeaux, giving them peremptory orders to put an instant end to the
feud in his name. It is written in French.</p>

<p class="letter">
     "Very dear and faithful.&mdash;Whereas we are given to understand that
     great discord and division prevails between our dear and
     well-beloved, the Lords de Montferrant and de Lescun, on account
     of the lands of the late Lord de Castalhan; we wish this to be
     appeased with all possible speed, in the best manner possible,
     just as we ourselves would be able to end it. So we wish, and we
     charge you, that, immediately on the sight of this, you take the
     whole charge into <i>our</i> [<i>? your</i>, <i>voz</i>, for <i>noz</i>] hands;

     trust in you.&mdash;Given under our signet, in our castle of Gisors,
     the 26th day of September."
</p>

<p>The following letter from Henry to the Bishop of Durham, his
Chancellor, dated 10th February 1418, and written whilst he was
engaged in the siege of Falaise, gives us a pleasing view of the care
with which he attended to the claims of individuals, and his desire to
do justice to a faithful servant.</p>

<p class="letter">
     "Worshipful Father in God, right trusty and well-beloved.
     Forasmuch
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page267" name="page267">(p. 267)</a></span>

     satisfaction] in the best wise as longeth unto him in this
     case.&mdash;Given under our signet, in our host beside our town of
     Falaise, the 10th day of
February."<a id="notetag198" name="notetag198"></a><a href="#note198">[198]</a>
</p>

<p>But whilst Henry could thus direct his thoughts to the redress of
individual grievances, in the midst of the din of war and the
excitement of the camp, he equally shows calmness, and presence of
mind, and comprehensive views of sound policy in his negociations with
foreign powers, and his instructions to his representatives at home.
In the spring of 1419, letters were received by Henry from several
cities of Flanders, which, together with his answers to them and his
instructions to his brother, will not be read without interest. The
towns of Ghent, Ypres, Bruges, and Franc apply to Henry for his
protection and friendship, or rather for a renewal or continuance of
that especial favour which they had enjoyed in former days; they refer
more particularly to the kindness of his "grandfather, John Duke of
Lancaster, of noble memory, who, because he was born among them, ever
showed them most singular love and regard." This letter,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page268" name="page268">(p. 268)</a></span>
written in French, and dated 24th March 1418, is given under the seals
of the three first towns, and the seal of the Abbot of St. Andrew for
the people of Franc, because they had no common seal. Henry's answer,
in Latin, assures them, "If the people of Flanders will behave towards
England as they are said to have done in times past, we shall rejoice
to give no less valuable indications of our favour than did our father
or grandfather; and we have instructed our brother, the Duke of
Bedford, and our council, to send ambassadors with full powers to
Calais, to negociate a peace between England and you." Probably Henry
did not pen this letter himself; but, whoever indited it, the letter
contains fewer barbarisms, and has more indications of classical
scholarship in the writer, than are often found in modern
Latin.<a id="notetag199" name="notetag199"></a><a href="#note199">[199]</a>
Henry forwarded both the Flemish prayer and his own answer to his
brother, with instructions in English; and, shortly after, he sent a
long letter to his Chancellor, the Bishop of Durham, as well on that
negociation, as on an affair in dispute between the English merchants
and the Genoese. This document shows how minutely Henry investigated
the matters on which he wrote; and how sensible a view he took of the
interests of our commerce, and how dispassionate was his judgment. The
Genoese had seized goods belonging to English merchants, who laid
claim for a compensation. Henry's letter states
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page269" name="page269">(p. 269)</a></span>
the exact sum
at which the English estimated their merchandise, and the lower price
fixed by the
Genoese;<a id="notetag200" name="notetag200"></a><a href="#note200">[200]</a>
and then, in consideration of the injury
done to English commerce by the Genoese letters of marque, Henry
recommends the English merchants to accept the offer made by the
Genoese, provided they stipulate that the English merchant vessels
shall have as free course of trade to Genoa as the Genoese desired to
have to the ports of England. This correspondence is found among the
"Proceedings of the Privy Council." The whole is well deserving the
perusal of any one interested in the history of British commerce, but
is on too extensive a scale for insertion at length in this
work.<a id="notetag201" name="notetag201"></a><a href="#note201">[201]</a></p>

<p>The only other instance which the Author of these Memoirs would add to
the preceding (though many and various examples of the same kind are
at <span class="pagenum"><a id="page270" name="page270">(p. 270)</a></span>
hand) is one which brings all the associations of opening
life before his mind, and recals days which can never be forgotten,
whilst they can never be remembered without the liveliest feelings of
gratitude to the Giver of every good. The days which he spent within
the walls of that college to which Henry's letter refers, are long ago
past and gone; but they have left a fragrance and relish on the mind,
and the remembrance of them is sweet.</p>

<p>Oriel College, founded by Edward II, not long before his unhappy
murder, for the promotion of sound learning and religious education,
has been, if any college ever was, faithful to its trust. When Henry
V. was (as we believe) studying under the care of his uncle, the
future Cardinal, John Carpenter, afterwards Bishop of Worcester, was
resident in Oriel; and between him and young Henry a close intimacy,
we are told, was formed. These friendships, cherished when the heart
is most warm, and the best feelings freshest, not only endear the two
friends to each other through life, but excite in each an interest in
whatever belongs to the other. On this principle we may believe that
Oriel College, and its peace and welfare, were objects of no ordinary
interest to Henry; certainly his friend, John Carpenter, felt so
grateful to the society in which he had imbibed the principles of
philosophy and religion, as to found one new fellowship in addition to
the eight of its original foundation, and the four founded by his
contemporary, though probably
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page271" name="page271">(p. 271)</a></span>
his senior, John Frank, Master
of the Rolls. About the time when Henry was pursuing his victories in
France, an unhappy dispute arose to interrupt the harmony of this
little community. Perfect peace is reserved for the faithful in
heaven; on earth we must not expect to pass through life either as
insulated individuals, or as members of any society, however sound may
be its principles, and however Christian may be the general temper of
its members, without some of those disturbing vexations which admonish
us (with many other warnings) not to suffer our hopes to anchor here.
Just as in a family, quarrels in a college are the more fatal to the
comfort of its members in proportion to the narrowness of the circle
which surrounds them, and to the closeness of the bond which more
frequently compels them to meet together. The citizen of the world may
avoid one whom he cannot meet with satisfaction and pleasure; the
inmate of a college comes in contact with his brethren every day. The
place of prayer, the refectory, the social board of kindly
intercourse, all well calculated to cherish and ripen feelings of
friendship, yet if unkind sentiments are lurking in the breast, only
provoke their expression, and cherish the heartburnings, and fan the
embers of discord into a flame.</p>

<p>In a college the first spark of unkindness, unbrotherly, anti-social
feelings, should especially be extinguished: disunion there is more
fatal to comfort and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page272" name="page272">(p. 272)</a></span>
ease, and peace of mind, and the
enjoyment of whatever blessings might otherwise be in store, than in
any other community except that of husband and wife, parent and child,
brother and brother. To no combination of Christians would the Apostle
with greater earnestness repeat his injunction, "Love one another."</p>

<p>What was the immediate subject of dispute at the time when Henry
interfered with Oriel College, the Author has never been able to
discover. There is no auxiliary evidence, and the only source of
reasonable conjecture must be the internal testimony of the King's
letter itself. The epistle is an original, preserved in the Tower of
London; its date is 7th of July, and in the town of Mante. This fixes
it (with as much certainty as we can ever expect in such matters) to
the year 1419; when Henry seems to have made Mante his chief residence
for some time, and was certainly there both before and after the 7th
of July in that year.</p>

<p>This letter is very interesting, particularly to Oriel men, for other
reasons, and especially because it contains indisputable proof of the
position maintained by them, that not the Chancellor, nor the King by
his Chancellor, but the King himself in person, is the visitor. May
his interference on a similar occasion be never again needed! May
discord between the Head and the Fellows, or between the Fellows among
themselves, be for ever banished! But should the voice and the hand of
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page273" name="page273">(p. 273)</a></span>
visitor be ever required "to stint the controversy," the
visitor of this "ancient and royal house"&mdash;is the King of England
only. The letter is in itself characteristic of Henry, and affords,
probably, a fair specimen of the style of an English gentleman of that
day.</p>

<p>"Worshipful father in God, our right trusty and well-beloved, we

     neither at the court of Rome nor elsewhere, but that that
     controversy should be put in respite unto our coming home with
     God's grace: for our occupation is such that we may not well

     shall make further pursuit of appeal at court of Rome, nor no
     manner of pursuit there, or elsewhere, as touching the said
     controversy, unto our coming as before; at which time our intent
     is to put the same controversy to a good and righteous

     to surcease. And we will furthermore, as touching our said

<p>Whilst <span class="pagenum"><a id="page275" name="page275">(p. 275)</a></span>
Henry was occupied by his campaign in France, a
parliament met October 16th, 1419, and voted one-fifteenth, and
one-tenth, and one-half part of them both. In this parliament that
enactment was made on which our authority chiefly rests for believing
the Queen-Dowager, Bolinbroke's widow, to have been guilty of
conspiring her son-in-law's death. The act, after declaring that she
was accused by friar John Randolf, and other credible witnesses, of
having compassed the King's death in the most horrible manner; and
that Roger Colles of Shrewsbury, and Peronell Brocart, lately living
with the Queen, were violently suspected of having been partners in
her guilt; enacted that all the lands, and castles, and possessions,
as well of the Queen as of her accomplices, should be seized for the
King's use, provision being made for the maintenance of the Queen and
her servants.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, much progress was made in France towards a peace between
Henry, the French King, and the young Duke of Burgundy. An armistice
was signed between Henry and Charles at Mante, November 20, but only
for the Isle of France; and, at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page276" name="page276">(p. 276)</a></span>
the close of the month, the
Duke of Burgundy, then at Arras, signed his consent to the articles
which Henry had commissioned his ambassadors to lay before him, which
were these:</p>

<p>First, that he should have the Princess of France in marriage.
Secondly, that he should not disturb the King of France in the
possession of the crown; but suffer him peaceably to enjoy it, and
receive its revenues as long as he lived. Thirdly, that the Queen also
should during her life retain her title and dignity, with such a part
of the revenues of the crown as would be suitable to maintain the
royal honour. Moreover, that the crown of France, with all its
dominions, should, after the death of the King, descend to Henry and
his heirs for ever; that, in consequence of the incapacity of the
King's mind, Henry should as Regent administer the affairs of
government, with a council of the nobles of France; with other
stipulations subservient to these grand fundamental points.</p>

<p>The Duke of Burgundy also agreed on certain
articles<a id="notetag203" name="notetag203"></a><a href="#note203">[203]</a>
of amity
between himself and Henry, stipulating to give his own support of
Henry's authority and rights as Regent and King; in return for Henry's
protection of him in all his rights, and against all his enemies,
especially against the murderers of his father.</p>

<p>To effect these great ends, a general armistice was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page277" name="page277">(p. 277)</a></span>
concluded at Rouen, December 24th, to continue to the 1st of March,
from which it was provided that the Dauphin should be excluded. This
truce was afterwards prolonged to March 24th. Meanwhile, the war was
vigorously carried on by the English and Burgundian forces against the
Dauphin; whilst on the confines of Normandy, where the English at that
time were stationed, every thing was conducted by the people of the
two nations in as amicable and familiar a manner as though the peace
had absolutely been concluded, and the English King were Regent of
France; an object, as they professed, most devoutly desired by the
people of Paris, who sent their deputies to bespeak the good offices
of Henry for the preservation of their rights and
liberties.<a id="notetag204" name="notetag204"></a><a href="#note204">[204]</a>
Henry's ambassadors made many objections to the terms of the proposed
treaty, chiefly on the ground that, by accepting them, Henry would
injure his then title to the throne of France. But he saw himself that
all essentials were provided for; and desirous of terminating the war,
and more anxious (we may believe) to make the beloved Princess his own
wife, left Rouen on his journey to Troyes, where the French court and
the Duke of Burgundy were. Henry passed so near to the walls of Paris,
that the people hastened out of the city to see him; and they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page278" name="page278">(p. 278)</a></span>
greeted him with joyous and welcoming acclamations.</p>

<p>Henry, arriving at Troyes, made an immediate visit to the King, the
Queen, and the Princess. How far the love of Henry towards Katharine
expedited the negociations we cannot tell. Every difficulty, however,
vanished; and a final agreement and perpetual peace was made and sworn
to "by Charles, King of France, and his dearest and most beloved son,
Henry, King of England, constituted heir of the crown and Regent of
France." Henry having consented during Charles's life not to assume
the title of King of France, Charles promised always to style Henry
"our most illustrious son, Henry, King of England, heir of France."
After Charles's death, the two kingdoms of England and France were to
be for ever united under one King. Many other articles swell this
solemn league, which are all subservient to these leading provisions.</p>

<p>This treaty was signed at Troyes, May 21, 1420, in the presence of the
Emperor Sigismund and many of the Continental princes, all of whom
became parties thereto. On the same day Katharine and Henry were
affianced before the high altar of St. Peter's Church, in Troyes; in
which city proclamation of the
peace<a id="notetag205" name="notetag205"></a><a href="#note205">[205]</a>
was made both in the French
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page279" name="page279">(p. 279)</a></span>
and the English tongue. It was afterwards proclaimed at
Paris, and the principal cities of France; and, on June 24, it was
proclaimed in London, after a solemn procession and a sermon at St.
Paul's Cross: and an ordinance was made for breaking the great seal of
England, and making another, on which to the King's title should be
added, "Regent and heir-apparent of France;" and a corresponding order
was given to the officers of his mint at Rouen for a change of the
inscription on the coinage
there."<a id="notetag206" name="notetag206"></a><a href="#note206">[206]</a></p>

<p>The <span class="pagenum"><a id="page280" name="page280">(p. 280)</a></span>
marriage of Henry with
Katharine<a id="notetag207" name="notetag207"></a><a href="#note207">[207]</a>
was celebrated with
great magnificence by the Archbishop of Sens, on the 30th of May, in
the presence of the principal nobility of Burgundy and France. The
Duke of Burgundy first, and then all the other assembled nobles, swore
allegiance to Henry, as Regent of France. "For," (as the
historians<a id="notetag208" name="notetag208"></a><a href="#note208">[208]</a>
say,) "the fame of his heroic actions in war, when his
person was unknown to them, had acquired him a universal esteem; and
they knew not what most to admire, his courage, conduct, or success.
But now
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page281" name="page281">(p. 281)</a></span>
his noble presence, in which there was a due mixture
of majesty with affable deportment, procured a greater veneration.
They knew him to be prudent in councils, experienced in war, of an
undaunted courage in dangers, and prosperous in all his enterprises;
and therefore they persuaded themselves that their country would be
happy under the influences of his government." It is said that they
were confirmed in these anticipations of good, as well as exceedingly
delighted, by the speech which he addressed to them in full assembly,
showing the moderation and temper of his soul. At the close of his
address they unanimously expressed their confidence in his honour, and
the highest regard for his interests.</p>

<p>The Dauphin, however, continued to prevent the establishment of peace;
and, having obtained from the Scotch parliament a reinforcement of
seven thousand men, under the command of the Earl of Buchan, still
proved a formidable enemy to Henry. But, never relaxing his exertion
whilst any thing remained to be done, Henry prepared most vigorously
to meet the forces thus united against
him.<a id="notetag209" name="notetag209"></a><a href="#note209">[209]</a></p>

<p>He retained still in his camp the King of Scotland, by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page282" name="page282">(p. 282)</a></span> whose
influence he had hoped to draw the Scots from the service of the
Dauphin; but they would not listen to their monarch whilst he was the
King of England's prisoner. The English army, however, was recruited
by a considerable reinforcement, which the Duke of Bedford had brought
over with him. He had governed England as Regent, during the King's
absence, with great zeal and wisdom; and he now left the Duke of
Gloucester to rule the kingdom in his stead.</p>

<p>Many cities and garrisons attached to the Dauphin held out with much
resolution and fidelity to his cause, and the English had full
employment in reducing them. The town of Melun was defended with most
determined obstinacy. During the protracted siege of this place, Henry
was surrounded by all the magnificence and state of a royal court
amidst the noise and disorders of war. His Queen, also, "with a
shining train of ladies," came to the camp; for whom "a fair house was
built, at such a distance as secured them from any danger of shot from
the town." The royal bride and bridegroom had been allowed a very
brief interval for that enjoyment of each other's society in
retirement and privacy which is denied to few in any rank of life
immediately on their union. Their marriage was solemnized on the 30th
of May at Paris, and for one short week only from that day are the
records silent as to Henry's residence. On the 7th of June he was at
Villeneuf, engaged again (if, indeed, there
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page283" name="page283">(p. 283)</a></span>
had been any
interruption of his public duties,) in the business of the state. From
July the 9th to the end of September he passed, with very few
exceptions, his day alternately at Paris, and in the camp before
Melun, which was about ten leagues from the capital. It was, we may
reasonably conjecture, to make this new life of war as little irksome
to Katharine as the circumstances would allow, and to provide an
additional source of amusement and gratification, that Henry sent to
England for those new harps for himself and his Queen, to the purchase
of which at that time we have already referred.</p>

<p>At the surrender of Melun, a circumstance took place characteristic of
Henry's firmness and justice, mingled at the same time with feelings
of friendship and kindheartedness. A gentleman of his household, who
had fought with him at Agincourt, and was high in his esteem, was
convicted on clear evidence of having received a bribe during the
treaty for the surrender of the town, which tempted him to favour the
escape of one suspected of being an accomplice in the Duke of
Burgundy's murder. The young Duke of Burgundy and the Duke of Clarence
petitioned for his pardon; but Henry gave orders for his execution,
saying he would have no traitors in his army. At the same time he was
heard to declare he would have given fifty thousand nobles that
Bertrand de Chaumont had not been guilty of such a crime.</p>

<p>Shortly <span class="pagenum"><a id="page284" name="page284">(p. 284)</a></span>
after the surrender of Melun, Charles and Henry went
together to Paris, accompanied by their Queens. The royal party were
met by the citizens with every demonstration of joy and devotedness;
and, in honour of Henry, most persons of quality dressed themselves in
red.<a id="notetag210" name="notetag210"></a><a href="#note210">[210]</a>
The first solemn act performed at Paris after the rejoicings
were ended, was the attainder of the Dauphin and his accomplices for
the murder of the Duke of Burgundy. He was denounced as unworthy of
succeeding to any inheritance, and sentenced to perpetual banishment;
judgment of death being pronounced against all his accomplices. A
knowledge of these proceedings only stimulated him to further acts of
violence.</p>

<p>Henry's court was at the Louvre, whilst Charles' was at the Hôtel de
St. Paul. The two courts were marked by a wide difference in splendour
and attendance. The palace of Charles was deserted, whilst Henry's was
crowded by almost all the great men of France.</p>

<p>Having now established the government of France, and provided for its
maintenance during his absence, Henry proceeded with his royal bride
towards England. In Normandy he was well received by the estates, who
were assembled at Rouen, and who voted him a subsidy of 400,000
livres. On leaving this place, he constituted the Duke of Clarence his
Lieutenant of Normandy, and gave commission to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page285" name="page285">(p. 285)</a></span>
Duke of
Exeter to administer the government in
Paris.<a id="notetag211" name="notetag211"></a><a href="#note211">[211]</a>
With his Queen and
the Duke of Bedford he reached his native land in safety on the last
day of January, or the first of February 1421; and he immediately
communicated to the Archbishop his wish for him to appoint a day of
public
thanksgiving.<a id="notetag212" name="notetag212"></a><a href="#note212">[212]</a></p>

1421-1422.</h3>


<p>Henry, now in the enjoyment of peace in England, Ireland, and France,
(except only so far as the Dauphin was yet unsubdued,) in the
enjoyment, too, of a union with the most beautiful Princess of the
age, seems to have reached the highest pinnacle of his ambition and
his hopes. The Queen was crowned with great solemnity and magnificence
in Westminster
Abbey,<a id="notetag213" name="notetag213"></a><a href="#note213">[213]</a>
on the third Sunday in Lent. (23rd February
1421.)</p>

<p>After
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page287" name="page287">(p. 287)</a></span>
Henry had gratified his royal consort by proving to
her how deep and lively an interest the people of England took in her
welfare and happiness, he retired with her for a time to Windsor. A
combination, however, of various motives, induced him to propose to
her to join him in the execution of a design on which he seems to have
been bent, and to accompany
him<a id="notetag214" name="notetag214"></a><a href="#note214">[214]</a>
in a progress through the
kingdom. He was most anxious to ascertain by personal inspection the
state and condition of his subjects in various parts of the realm;
more especially with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page288" name="page288">(p. 288)</a></span>
the view of satisfying himself that
justice was impartially administered, crimes repressed, and innocence
protected. He felt also naturally a desire to present his loyal
subjects to his Queen, of whom we have many proofs that he was in no
ordinary degree proud; and, at the same time, to add to her
gratification by visiting in her society those places with which he
had early associations of pleasure, or which it would be most
interesting to a foreigner to see. He was also influenced, perhaps, in
some measure by a desire of visiting, in a sort of pilgrimage, the
shrine of the patron saint of his family, John of Bridlington; and
that of John of Beverley, the saint to whose merits the hierarchy, as
we have seen, so presumptuously ascribed the turn of the battle on the
day of Agincourt.</p>


<p>With these
motives,<a id="notetag215" name="notetag215"></a><a href="#note215">[215]</a>
combined, it may be, with others, Henry lost
no time in carrying his intention into effect. He seems to have always
acted under a practical sense of the maxim, never to put off till
to-morrow what is to be done, and what may be done, to-day. Without
waiting for the summer, or a more advanced stage of the spring,&mdash;and,
had he delayed for longer days and more genial weather, the journey
would never have been taken,&mdash;we conclude that, about the beginning of
the second week in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page289" name="page289">(p. 289)</a></span>
March, the King and Queen, attended by a
large retinue of friends and nobles, began their journey
northward.<a id="notetag216" name="notetag216"></a><a href="#note216">[216]</a>
The first place in which we are sure they rested is
Coventry, which they reached probably about the 8th of March, and
where they were certainly on the 15th of that month, the eve of Palm
Sunday. Henry had a house at Coventry, in right of the duchy of
Cornwall, called Cheylesmoor; and probably they took up their abode in
that mansion during their stay at Coventry. The greater part of the
time spent in Warwickshire was perhaps passed in the castle of
Kenilworth, a favourite residence of his grandfather, John of Gaunt,
who made very great additions to the mansion, always afterwards called
the Lancaster Buildings. Henry himself, too, had been much employed in
improving this place, and surrounding it with pleasure-grounds and
arbours,<a id="notetag217" name="notetag217"></a><a href="#note217">[217]</a>
instead of the thorns and brakes which had formerly been
seen there. Just seven years before this visit with his Queen, he had
drained and planted the rough land near the castle; and the local
historians tells us the spot was called "The Plesance in the Marsh."</p>

<p>From Kenilworth the royal party went (probably about the 20th of
March) to their house at Leicester, where
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page290" name="page290">(p. 290)</a></span>
they kept the
festival of
Easter.<a id="notetag218" name="notetag218"></a><a href="#note218">[218]</a>
Easter Sunday fell that year on the 23rd of
March. Could Henry have known of the sad calamity which befel him that
very Easter, his rejoicings would have been turned into mourning. It
was at that very time that the disastrous conflict took place, in
which the English were routed, and the Duke of Clarence, whom Henry
had left his representative on the Continent, was slain. Where the
King was when the melancholy tidings reached him, and which induced
him to cut short his progress, does not appear. We know that the
joyful news of Agincourt reached London on the fourth morning after
the battle; and probably the sad report of his brother's death, and of
the discomfiture of his troops, was posted on to Henry whilst he was
at York. Towards this, his northern capital, we conclude that he
proceeded from Leicester, about the last day of March. The inhabitants
of York had made most costly preparations for the reception of their
royal visitors; and on their arrival they welcomed their conquering
sovereign, and the partner of his joys and cares, with every
demonstration of loyalty and devotedness. The most princely presents
were offered to Henry in the most dutiful and cordial spirit of loving
and admiring subjects. How many days they remained together
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page291" name="page291">(p. 291)</a></span>
amidst the festivities and rejoicings of the province of York, is not
recorded; perhaps the limit to this festival was the hour when the
gloom which spread over the kingdom on the death of Clarence reached
the royal party. It is not improbable that the news of his loss gave a
turn to Henry's mind, and induced him with sentiments of piety and
mourning to leave the splendour of his court for a while, and, laying
aside the feelings of the triumphant monarch, to give himself up to
exercises of devotion, and to a preparation for the same awful change
which had so unexpectedly stopped the career of his younger brother.
Leaving his Queen among his friends and faithful lieges of York, he
proceeded on a kind of pilgrimage to Bridlington, Beverley, and
Lincoln;<a id="notetag219" name="notetag219"></a><a href="#note219">[219]</a>
but in what order he visited those places it does not
appear. He was at York on the 4th of April, and again on the 18th;
whilst it is equally certain that on the 15th he was at Lincoln.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page292" name="page292">(p. 292)</a></span>
The author of the manuscript which tells us that his object in
going to Lincoln was to be present at the installation of Richard
Flemming, then lately elected Bishop, seems to be in error when he
adds, that the King rejoined the Queen at Pontefract, and thence
proceeded to Lincoln, and thence to London; unless, indeed, the King
visited Lincoln once by himself, and once with Katharine; a
supposition in the last degree improbable. He certainly returned to
York after his sojourn at Lincoln on the 15th. It is very probable
that, when he left York, he proceeded first to Bridlington, thence to
Beverley, and so, crossing the Humber at Hull, reached Lincoln about
the 13th of April, and, having passed two or three days there,
returned to York on the 17th. The only other town mentioned by
chroniclers is Pontefract. Documents may, perhaps, be hereafter
discovered to account for him between the 18th of April, when he was
certainly at York, and the 1st of May, when he had returned to
Westminster. At present we are left to conjecture: but it cannot be
thought improbable if we suppose that, from his castle of Pontefract,
(where he would have seen the Duke of
Orleans<a id="notetag220" name="notetag220"></a><a href="#note220">[220]</a>,
then a prisoner
there, whom he always treated
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page293" name="page293">(p. 293)</a></span>
with respect and kindness, and
whom he indulged with as much relaxation of his confinement as was
compatible with his safe custody,) he took the route for Chester, the
place where he had formerly landed on his return from Trym Castle.
Thence pointing out to his bride the country of Glyndowrdy, in which
he passed his noviciate in arms; and the whole line of the Welsh
borders, with which he had been long familiar, he would probably have
passed on to Shrewsbury, where he might have taken Katharine to the
spot in the battle-field on which Hotspur fell. From Shrewsbury, his
line would be through Worcester, in which city he had often been
stationed during the Welsh rebellion; and so onwards through Oxford,
(a place he probably had visited on his journey northward, and where
he would have been delighted to show Katharine the "narrow chamber"
assigned to him when he studied there,) thus finishing his circuit
where it began, at Windsor.</p>

<p>There are difficulties attending this supposition, to the existence of
which the Author is fully alive; but in the whole affair there is only
a choice of difficulties. He is aware that the journey from York
through Chester and Shrewsbury to Windsor would have required the
royal party to travel for fourteen days at the rate of twenty miles on
the average each day consecutively. But, on the other hand, without
such a supposition, the old
chroniclers<a id="notetag221" name="notetag221"></a><a href="#note221">[221]</a>
must <span class="pagenum"><a id="page294" name="page294">(p. 294)</a></span> be
altogether laid aside, (though there is no other evidence to make
their statement improbable,) when they assure us that Henry took
Katharine to visit his principality, as well as the distant parts of
his
kingdom.<a id="notetag222" name="notetag222"></a><a href="#note222">[222]</a>
It must, moreover, be borne in mind that although he
might have felt a reluctance (notwithstanding the melancholy event
which hastened his return to the capital) to break off his intended
progress without visiting at least the borders of Wales, yet he was
pressed for time, and would therefore not willingly lose a day on the
road. Be this as it may, we are
assured<a id="notetag223" name="notetag223"></a><a href="#note223">[223]</a>
that, wherever he went,
his ears were in all places open to the complaints of the injured and
oppressed; he redressed their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page295" name="page295">(p. 295)</a></span>
wrongs, punished the perverters
of public trusts, reformed many abuses in the local governments, and
established such ordinances as should secure for the future the
impartial administration of justice to high and low alike.</p>

<p>If, as we are led to believe, Henry returned by the way of Chester,
his ardent imagination and pious turn of thought would have reverted
with mingled feelings of wonder and gratitude to his journey along the
same road two-and-twenty years before; when, returning from his own
captivity in Ireland, he accompanied the captive Richard towards his
metropolis, to resign his throne there, and soon afterwards to lay
down his life. To Henry, indeed, mementos presented themselves on
every side of the frailty of all sublunary possessions, the precarious
tenure by which king or peasant alike holds any earthly thing; whilst
he was himself destined, in the revolution of the next year, to become
in his own person a marked example of the same uncertainty. His spirit
might seem to address us from the grave, in the words of a reflecting
man.<a id="notetag224" name="notetag224"></a><a href="#note224">[224]</a>
"A day, an hour, a moment is sufficient for the overthrow of
dominions which are thought to be grounded on foundations of adamant."</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>Where Henry was when the unexpected news arrested his progress is not
known. The certainty is, that whilst he was anxiously engaged in
reforming abuses,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page296" name="page296">(p. 296)</a></span>
and preparing good laws at home; after he
had also just concluded a peace with Genoa, and, by generously
releasing the King of Scotland, had bound him by the strongest ties of
gratitude and affection; his exertions were suddenly arrested by the
sad news of the defeat of his forces at Baugy in Anjou, and the death,
in battle, of his brother, the Duke of
Clarence.<a id="notetag225" name="notetag225"></a><a href="#note225">[225]</a>
These tidings
caused him to shorten his progress, and to return to his capital,
where he arrived at furthest on the 1st of May.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Durham, Chancellor of England, was charged to open the
Parliament, which met on the second of that month, Henry himself being
present, in the Painted Chamber. The Chancellor's address, though in
many points strange, and well-nigh ridiculous, is too interesting to
be passed by unnoticed. He began by uttering eulogies on the King,
specifying, among other topics of praise, this merit in
particular,&mdash;that, whilst God had granted him victories and conquests
as the fruits of his labour, he never assumed the least merit to
himself, but ascribed all the glory to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page297" name="page297">(p. 297)</a></span>
God only, "<i>following
in a manner the example of the very valiant Emperor Julius Cæsar</i>;"
and also because as Job, when news was brought to him of the death of
all his children as they were feasting in their eldest brother's
house, praised God, saying, "The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken
away, the will of the Lord be done; blessed be the name of the Lord!"
so our sovereign Lord the King, when he first heard of the death of
the noble prince, the Duke of Clarence, his own dear brother, and of
the gallant knights and others slain with him, praised and blessed God
for the visitation of that calamity, as he had before had cause to
praise Him for all his prosperity. In declaring the cause of summoning
this Parliament, he mentions the desire the King had of rectifying,
according to right and justice, all abuses and wrongs which had
prevailed through the realm since his last passage to foreign lands,
especially to the injury of those who had been with him there; and
also his wish that all the laws of the realm should be maintained and
enforced, and that further provision should be made for the
<a id="notetag226" name="notetag226"></a><a href="#note226">[226]</a>better
governance, and peace, and universal good of the realm.
The Parliament, it is said, cheerfully voted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page298" name="page298">(p. 298)</a></span> him a
fifteenth,<a id="notetag227" name="notetag227"></a><a href="#note227">[227]</a>
though many persons petitioned against further
taxation, and gave utterance to sad complaints of their poverty. The
Convocation also met on May 5th, and on the 12th; they voted him a
tenth from the revenues of the clergy: and his uncle, the Bishop of
Winchester, advanced to him by way of loan twenty thousand pounds. The
Parliament guaranteed payment of the loans to all who should advance
money to the King for this expedition.</p>

<p>Henry, impatient to repair the dishonour of the defeat which his
forces had sustained, and to reduce his foreign dominions to peace,
issued his writ, on the 27th of May, to the sheriffs of the several
counties to publish his proclamation that all persons should
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page299" name="page299">(p. 299)</a></span>
hasten with the utmost speed to join the King, and accompany him in
his voyage. And now possessing under his command a larger force than
he had ever yet raised; after procuring by subsidies and loans as
large a sum as the power or inclination of his people supplied; having
also appointed his brother, the Duke of Bedford, Regent; he left
London (never to return to it alive), on the last day of May, or the
1st of June. From the 1st to the 10th of that month he seems to have
passed his days alternately at Canterbury and Dover; though the cause
of this delay does not appear to have been recorded. To whatever the
postponement of his departure is attributable, though he left the
metropolis not later than the 1st, he did not finally quit the English
shores till the 10th of June. On the 12th he was at
Rouen.<a id="notetag228" name="notetag228"></a><a href="#note228">[228]</a></p>

<p>The Dauphin himself with a large army was at this time besieging
Chartres, and Henry having passed by Abbeville, Beauvais, Gisors, and
Mante, marched himself with strong hand to raise that siege. On
Henry's approach the Dauphin withdrew.</p>

<p>Some of these facts, with others, are contained in a letter which was
forwarded from Henry to the mayor and citizens of London, (it is the
last we shall have occasion to transcribe,) and which is chiefly
remarkable for his language when speaking of the Dauphin.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page300" name="page300">(p. 300)</a></span> He
will not acknowledge him to have any right to the title, and calls him
a pretender. Another point of considerable interest is the unqualified
manner in which he speaks of the cordial co-operation and sincere
attachment of the young Duke of Burgundy.</p>

<div class="letter">
<p><span class="smcap">BY THE KING.</span></p>

<p> "Trusty and well-beloved, we greet you well. And for as much as
     we be certain that ye will be joyful to hear good tiding of our
     estate and welfare, we signifie unto you that we be in good
     health and prosperity of our person; and so be our brother of
     Gloucester, and bel-uncle of Exeter, and all the remnant of lords
     and other persons of our host, blessed be our Lord, which grant
     you so for to be! Witting, moreover, that in our coming by
     Picardy we had disposed us for to have tarried somewhat in the
     country, for to have set it, with God's help, in better
     governance; and, while we were busy to intend therto, come
     tidings unto us that he that clepeth him [calleth himself]
     Dauphin was coming down with a great puissance unto Chartres.
     Wherefore we drove us in all haste to Paris, as well for to set
     our father of France, as the said good town of Paris, in sure
     governance, and from thence unto this our town of Mante, at which
     place we arrived on Wednesday last, to the intent for to have
     given succours, with God's grace, unto the said town of Chartres;
     and hither come unto us our brother of Burgundy with a fair
     fellowship, for to have gone with us to the said succours; the
     which our brother of Burgundy we find right a trusty, loving, and
     faithful brother unto us in all things. But, in our coming from
     Paris unto this our town of Mante, we were certified upon the
     way, by certain letters that were sent unto us, that the said
     pretense Dauphin, for certain causes that moved him, hath raised
     the said siege, and is gone into the country of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page301" name="page301">(p. 301)</a></span>
     Touraine in great haste, as it is said. And we trust fully unto
     our Lord that, through his grace and mercy, all things here, that
     we shall have to do with, shall go well from henceforth, to his
     plesance and worship; who we beseech devoutly that it so may be,
     and to have you in his keeping!&mdash;Given under our signet, in our
     host, at our town of Mante, the 12th day of July."</p>
</div>

<p>Though the Dauphin avoided Henry altogether, he was forced to engage
with the Duke of Burgundy's army, and he suffered a most decided
defeat near Blanche Tache. Henry, meanwhile, was engaged in reducing
Dreux and other towns, still garrisoned for the Dauphin.</p>

<p>The town of Meaux was so strong, and so well manned, that the siege of
that one place occupied Henry from the 6th of October through the
whole winter, and to the very end of the next April. During this
protracted siege, in which the Earls of Dorset, and of Worcester, and
Lord Clifford were killed, Henry sent ambassadors to the Emperor
Sigismund for succours. He had the satisfaction, meanwhile, to hear
that his Queen was delivered of a son, at Windsor, on St. Nicholas'
day (December 6th). Whether the common report has any foundation in
truth, cannot now be certainly known: his father, however, is said to
have omened ill of the young prince when he heard of the place of his
birth, and to have spoken thus to Lord Fitz-Hugh, his chamberlain: "My
lord, I Henry, born at Monmouth, shall small time reign and get much;
and Henry,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page302" name="page302">(p. 302)</a></span>
born at Windsor, shall long reign and lose all:
but God's will be done!" Probably this was a prophecy forged after the
event, and ascribed to Henry without any foundation in truth.</p>

<p>In the session of Parliament held December 1st, 1421, under the Duke
of Bedford as Regent, one fifteenth was voted for prosecuting the war,
with this condition appended, that the first half of it should be paid
in the money then current. The gold coin had been much lessened in
value by clipping and washing; consequently the Parliament, to relieve
the people, ordained that the receivers of the tax should take all
light pieces, not wanting in weight more than 12<i>d.</i> in the noble. The
people, therefore, got rid of their gold as fast as they could, and
hoarded up their
silver.<a id="notetag229" name="notetag229"></a><a href="#note229">[229]</a>
The Convocation also, which met at York,
September 22nd, granted a tenth.</p>

<p>After reducing many towns and castles, Henry proceeded to the Château
Bois de Vincennes, near Paris, to meet his
Queen,<a id="notetag230" name="notetag230"></a><a href="#note230">[230]</a>
who had landed
at Harfleur, on the 21st of May, with a noble retinue, and under
convoy of the Regent himself. Henry and Katharine entered Paris
together, where they were magnificently received; the same painful
contrast still being felt by Charles between his court and that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page303" name="page303">(p. 303)</a></span>
of his heir-apparent. The young King had put the spirit of the
Parisians to the test by a strong measure, in levying a most unpopular
tax; but the discontent did not break out into any open tumult. Indeed
(as the chroniclers record) their resentments were abated, or rather
turned into affection, when they felt the kind influences of King
Henry's just and moderate government, and observed his exact
administration of justice in redressing wrongs, and punishing without
partiality or favour the authors of them. By this just conduct he
gained especially the love of the people, who regarded him as their
father and protector.</p>

<p>The Dauphin in the mean time was anxiously bent on recovering a crown
from which the victories of Henry, and the displeasure of the King his
father, had excluded him. His army was comparatively small, and he
therefore, whilst Henry was with an army in the neighbourhood, avoided
a battle, keeping always two days' march distant from him. Finding,
however, that Henry was now, at length, far away, he laid siege to
Cone, a town on the Loire, the garrison of which agreed to surrender
on the 16th of August, if they were not by that time relieved by the
Duke of Burgundy. The Duke not only sent into Flanders and Picardy to
levy troops to raise this siege, but importuned Henry also to
strengthen him with English soldiers and officers. The King's answer
was that he would come
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page304" name="page304">(p. 304)</a></span>
himself at the head of his whole army
to the Duke's relief. This was his resolution; but God decreed
otherwise.</p>

<p>Very shortly after this resolution, Henry was seized by a disorder, on
the exact nature of which historians are not agreed, which proved
fatal to him. Yet, though much weakened, he resolved to join his army,
which, at the first approach of his disorder, he had commanded the
Duke of Bedford to lead on to raise the siege of Cone. With this
intention he left the
King<a id="notetag231" name="notetag231"></a><a href="#note231">[231]</a>
and Queen of France, and his own
beloved Katharine, at Senlis, and proceeded to Melun. His complaint
was then making rapid and deadly progress; and, after having been
carried in a litter with the intention of passing through his troops,
he was compelled to return to
Vincennes.<a id="notetag232" name="notetag232"></a><a href="#note232">[232]</a>
The Duke of Bedford, who
had raised the siege of Cone without striking a blow, hearing now of
the state of danger in which his brother was, left the army, and,
accompanied by a few friends, rode full speed towards the castle,
where the King lay.</p>

<p>Henry, sensible that his end was fast approaching, desired the Duke of
Bedford, the Duke of Exeter, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page305" name="page305">(p. 305)</a></span>
Earl of Warwick, Sir Lewis
Robessart, and some others, to stand round his bed; to whom we are
told he spoke to this effect: "I am come," said he, "to the end of a
life which, though short, has yet been glorious, and employed to
advance the good and honour of my people. I confess it has been spent
in war and blood; yet, since the only motive of that war was to
vindicate my rights after I had ineffectually tried milder methods,
the guilt of all the miseries it occasioned belongs not to me, but to
my enemies. As death never appeared formidable to me in so many
battles and sieges, so now, without horror, I regard it making its
gradual approach. And since it is the will of my Creator now to put a
period to my day, I cheerfully submit myself to his will." He then
mentioned two circumstances which tended to make him anxious on
leaving the world: the one, that the war was not brought to a close;
the other, that his son was an infant. But he was comforted on both
these points by the tried friendship and sound principles of the Duke
of Bedford, his brother; to whom he gave in charge both his kingdom
and his boy. He then desired the Earl of Warwick to undertake the
office of preceptor and guide to the young prince in learning and in
arms. Henry next left a charge for his brother Humfrey to be careful
that no division of affection and interests should take place between
them; he conjured them also not to quarrel with the Duke of Burgundy,
and enjoined them not to release
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page306" name="page306">(p. 306)</a></span>
the Duke of Orleans, and
some other prisoners, till his son was arrived at years of discretion.</p>

<p>This was a mournful hour for those noblemen and friends and relatives
who surrounded his bed. At length, having given all necessary
directions for the government of his kingdom and his
family,<a id="notetag233" name="notetag233"></a><a href="#note233">[233]</a> he
fixed his thoughts wholly on another world. He urged the physicians to
tell him the real state of his disease; but they evaded any direct
answer. Very soon he required them to tell him how long, in all human
probability, he had to live. After some consultation, one of them,
speaking for the rest, knelt down and said, "Sir, think of your soul;
for, without a miracle, in our judgment you cannot survive two hours."
His confessor and other ministers of religion then surrounded his bed,
and administered the parting rite of the Roman church, as it was at
that time and is still practised. He next desired them to join in the
seven penitential psalms; and when in the 51st psalm they read, "Build
thou the walls of Jerusalem," caught by the words, Henry bade them
stop awhile; and with a loud voice declared to them, on the faith of a
dying person, that it verily had been his fixed purpose, after
settling peace in France, to proceed against the infidels, and rescue
Jerusalem from their tyranny, if it had pleased his Creator
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page307" name="page307">(p. 307)</a></span>
to lengthen out his days. He then requested them to proceed; and when
they had finished their devotions, between two and three o'clock in
the morning, he breathed his last.</p>

<p>Henry of Monmouth died 31st August 1422; and when he resigned his soul
into the hands of his Redeemer, he seemed to fall asleep rather than
to expire.<a id="notetag234" name="notetag234"></a><a href="#note234">[234]</a></p>

<p>Such a Christian end of his mortal existence is not surprising when we
remember (a point on which his own chaplain will not suffer us to
doubt,) that every day of his life he read and meditated upon the word
of God, for the express purpose of learning how best to fear and serve
him; a daily exercise (says the chaplain) from which, when he was
engaged in it, no one even of his chief nobles and the great men of
his state<a id="notetag235" name="notetag235"></a><a href="#note235">[235]</a>
could withdraw him.<a id="notetag236" name="notetag236"></a><a href="#note236">[236]</a></p>

<p class="letter">
     The bowels of Henry were buried in the monastery of St. Maur; and
     his body embalmed, being put into a leaden coffin, was drawn to
     St. Denis. Before and behind the corpse were two lamps burning;
     and two hundred and fifty torches gave light to the procession.
     The Abbot and Monks of St. Denis came out to meet it, and
     solemnly preceded it to their church,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page308" name="page308">(p. 308)</a></span> where they
     performed the office for the dead, the Archbishop of Paris
     singing the requiem. From St. Denis the procession advanced to
     Paris, where the body was deposited for a while in Notre Dame;
     and thence, with great and solemn pomp, it was carried to Rouen.
     The Queen, from whom the death of her husband had been before
     concealed, here met the Duke of Bedford; and made preparations
     for the conveyance of the body to England. In a bed, in the same
     carriage with the body, was laid the figure of the King, with a
     crown of gold on his head, a sceptre in his right hand, and a
     ball in his left. The covering of the bed was vermilion silk
     embroidered with gold, and over the chariot was a rich silk
     canopy. The chariot was drawn by six horses in rich harness. The
     first bore the arms of St. George, the second, the arms of
     Normandy; the third, those of King Arthur; the fourth, those of
     St. Edward; the fifth, the arms of France; the sixth, the arms of
     England and France. James, King of Scots, followed it as
     principal mourner. The banners of the saints were borne by four
     lords. The hatchments were carried by twelve captains; and around
     the carriage rode five hundred men-at-arms, all in black
     armour,&mdash;their horses barbed black, and their lances held with
     the points downwards. A great company clothed in white, and
     bearing lighted torches, "encompassed the hearse." Those of the
     King's household followed, and after them the royal family; the
     Queen, with a great retinue, followed at a league's distance.
     Whenever the corpse rested masses were sung from the first dawn
     of the morning till nine o'clock. The procession passed through
     Abbeville to Calais; and crossing to Dover, proceeded with the
     same solemnities towards London. When they approached the
     capital, they were met by fifteen bishops in their pontifical
     habits, and many abbots in their mitres and vestments, with a
     great company of priests and people. The princes of the royal
     family went mourning next to the hearse. The corpse was buried in
     Westminster Abbey, among its most valued treasures.

<p>Among <span class="pagenum"><a id="page309" name="page309">(p. 309)</a></span>
the public acts<a id="notetag237"
name="notetag237"></a><a href="#note237">[237]</a> of the realm his death is thus
recorded:</p>


     <p class="smcap">"DEPARTED THIS LIFE, AT THE CASTLE OF BOIS DE VINCENNES, NEAR
     PARIS, ON THE LAST DAY OF AUGUST, IN THE YEAR 1422, AND THE TENTH
     OF HIS REIGN, THE MOST CHRISTIAN CHAMPION OF THE CHURCH, THE
     BRIGHT BEAM OF WISDOM, THE MIRROR OF JUSTICE, THE UNCONQUERED
     KING, THE FLOWER AND PRIDE OF ALL CHIVALRY&mdash;<b>HENRY THE FIFTH</b>, KING
     OF ENGLAND, HEIR AND REGENT OF FRANCE, AND LORD OF IRELAND."</p>



<p>Here we would have drawn the curtain round the bed of Henry of
Monmouth; but truth and justice compel us to tarry somewhat longer in
the chamber of death. The tongue and pen of calumny have not suffered
the dying hero to pour out his soul with his last breath in prayer and
pious ejaculations unmolested; and the accuser's name is too widely
known, and has unhappily gained too much influence in the world, for
his calumnies to be passed over as harmless. Henry, having "set his
house in order," and being certified how short a time he had to live,
declares, on the faith of a dying man, that he had been fully resolved
(had the Almighty granted him length of days to put his resolve into
effect) to proceed in person to the Holy Land, and rescue the city of
God from the pollutions and abominations of the infidels. In recording
this declaration of the expiring monarch, Hume adds a comment as full
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page310" name="page310">(p. 310)</a></span>
of bitter sarcasm as it is tinctured with his characteristic
spirit of scepticism. "So ingenious are men in deceiving themselves,
that Henry forgot in these moments all the blood spilt by his
ambition, and received comfort from this late and feeble resolve;
which, as the mode of those enterprises was now past, he certainly
would never have carried into execution." Had Hume been as faithful
and painstaking in the search of truth, as he was ready to adopt the
account of any transaction which was nearest at hand, and unscrupulous
in substituting his own hasty remarks in the place of well-weighed
reflections on ascertained facts, he never would have suffered so
ignorant and ill-founded a comment to disgrace his pages.
Hume<a id="notetag238" name="notetag238"></a><a href="#note238">[238]</a>
charges Henry with having left the world, forgetful of the
bloodguiltiness by which his soul was stained, and with a sentence of
hypocrisy and falsehood on his lips. To the first charge,&mdash;that Henry,
at the awful moment of his dissolution, deceived himself into a
forgetfulness "of all the blood spilt by his ambition,"&mdash;needs only to
be replied, that so far from his having forgotten the loss of human
life attendant upon his wars, the very page on which the historian is
so severely commenting, records that Henry spoke of that subject
openly and unreservedly to those who stood around his bed, expressing
his sure trust that the guilt of that blood did not stain his soul,
who sought
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page311" name="page311">(p. 311)</a></span>
only his just inheritance; but rested on the heads
of those who, by their obstinate perseverance in injustice, compelled
him to appeal to the God of battle in vindication of his own rights.</p>

<p>Again, Henry declares, on the faith of a dying Christian Prince, that
it had verily been his fixed resolution, as soon as his wars in France
had been brought to a favourable issue, to proceed to the Holy Land.
Hume says that this was a late and feeble resolve; and the ground on
which he rests this charge of falsehood is, that the mode of those
enterprises was then past. Hume ought to have known, as an ordinary
historian, that the mode of those enterprises was not then past; and
Hume might have known that Henry's was not a death-bed resolve, to
which the expiring self-deceiver clung for comfort when the world was
receding from his sight; but that in his health and strength, and in
the mid-career of his victories, he had actually taken preliminary
measures for facilitating the execution of that very design.</p>

<p>With regard to the first position asserted by Hume, that "the mode of
these enterprises was gone by," the facts of history are so far from
authorizing him to make such an assertion, that they combine to expose
its rashness and unsoundness. When Henry succeeded to the throne, he
found a large naval and military force actually prepared by his father
for the proclaimed purpose of executing such an enterprise, the
undertaking of which was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page312" name="page312">(p. 312)</a></span>
only prevented by his
death.<a id="notetag239" name="notetag239"></a><a href="#note239">[239]</a>
And even a century after, the mode of those enterprises had not yet
passed; for Pope Leo X. successfully negociated a league between the
chief powers of Christendom, engaging them to unite against the
infidel dominion of the Turk. Not only were such crusades subjects of
serious and practical consideration in Europe just before Henry's
accession to the throne, and a full century after it, but, during the
last years of Henry's life, most vigorous and persevering exertions
were made by the Sovereign Pontiff to effect an immediate expedition
of the confederated powers of Christendom to Palestine, with the
avowed purpose of crushing the power of the infidels. The histories of
those times bear varied evidence to the same points: we must here,
however, confine our attention to some facts more immediately
connected with the case before us. In the year
1420,<a id="notetag240" name="notetag240"></a><a href="#note240">[240]</a>
July 12,
Pope Martin V, conceiving that Sigismund would very shortly bring the
war which he was then waging against the Hussites in Bohemia to an
end, in a bull dated Florence calls upon all Kings, Prelates, Lords,
and people, adjuring them most solemnly, by the shedding of Christ's
blood, to join Sigismund, and under his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page313" name="page313">(p. 313)</a></span>
standard to invade
the lands of the Turks, and to exterminate them. He urges the
formation of one grand general army, and for all true men to take the
cross; with his apostolic promise to all who should so assume the
cross, and join the army in their own persons and at their own
charges, and also to all who should take up arms with the <i>bonâ fide</i>
intention of joining the army, should they die on their journey, a
full remission of all sins of which they should have repented from the
heart, and confessed with the mouth; and, "in the retribution of the
just, we promise them (says the Pontiff) an increase of eternal
salvation."<a id="notetag241" name="notetag241"></a><a href="#note241">[241]</a></p>

<p>In the following year the Pope wrote a most urgent letter to
Sigismund, pressing upon him, before and above all things, the duty of
extirpating the heresy in Bohemia; assuring him that, however
brilliant might be his career in other respects, yet by no means could
he so well secure the favour of God, renown among men, and the
stability of his throne. The Pontiff, in the same year, wrote
repeatedly to Henry, King of England, urging him to consent to terms
of peace between his country and France. We should have been glad had
we been able to contemplate the Pontiff of Rome, in the character of a
Christian mediator, urging two contending nations to be reconciled,
solely with the Christian desire of stopping the dominion of war and
blood, reconciling those who were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page314" name="page314">(p. 314)</a></span>
at variance, checking the
violent passions of mankind, and restoring to Europe the blessing of
peace. But his desire was to reconcile France and England, in order
that the concentrated powers of the faithful in Europe might be turned
against the heretics in the north; and, when they were exterminated,
then that the same forces might proceed to crush the infidel, and
rescue the lands of the faithful from his grasp. The ecclesiastical
historian,<a id="notetag242" name="notetag242"></a><a href="#note242">[242]</a>
who records the letters of the Sovereign Pontiff,
assures us that Henry, King of England, had been repeatedly admonished
by "the vicar of Christ to make peace with the French, and to dedicate
to Christ his skill in war against the Turks, those savage enemies of
the Gospel; adding (what the facts of the case did not justify him in
saying,) that, in the agonies of his last illness, Henry confessed
that he was dreadfully tormented with remorse because he had not
consecrated his martial powers by waging war against the
Mahometans."<a id="notetag243" name="notetag243"></a><a href="#note243">[243]</a>
Surely this testimony is of itself sufficient to
rescue Henry's memory from having vowed that he had resolved to do
what he knew he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page315" name="page315">(p. 315)</a></span>
never could have done. "The mode of those
enterprises was" not "past."</p>

<p>But Hume would have it believed that this was a late and feeble
resolve of Henry, formed on his death-bed, when he was acting the part
of a self-deceiver, forgetful of the lamentable effects of his
ambition, and seeking comfort from his self-deception in the last
moments of his life. There is strong and clear evidence that he not
only had contemplated such a measure, but had actually taken important
preliminary steps to facilitate the execution of his design, whenever
he might be happily released from his present engagements. "This
vindicatory evidence" (to use the words of Mr. Granville
Penn)<a id="notetag244" name="notetag244"></a><a href="#note244">[244]</a>
"of the veracity and sincerity of Henry, is a manuscript discovered at
Lille, in Flanders, in the autumn of 1819, which proves to positive
demonstration, that at the moment when Henry was suddenly arrested in
his victorious progress by the hand of death, his mind was actually,
though secretly, engaged in projecting an attack on the infidel power
in Egypt and Syria, as soon as he should have pacified the internal
agitations of France; and that a confidential military agent of high
character and distinguished rank had been despatched by him to survey
the maritime frontier of those two countries, and to procure, upon the
spot, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page316" name="page316">(p. 316)</a></span>
the information necessary towards embarking in so vast
an enterprise.</p>

<p>"The manuscript is a small quarto in vellum, in old French, finely
written in black character, and richly illuminated; consisting of
fifty-four pages, and comprising a succinct military survey of the
coasts and defences of Egypt and Syria, from Alexandria round to
Gallipoli, made by the command of Henry within the three last years of
his life, and completed and reported immediately after his unexpected
death, by which death it was rendered unavailing. The confidential
author of this survey was Gilbert de Lannoi, counsellor and
chamberlain to Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, and that Duke's
ambassador to Henry."</p>

<p>The same writer thus expresses himself in conclusion. "His declaration
was not the prompting of a sickly conscience striving to procure
delusive comfort from 'the late and feeble' resolves of a death-bed,
as Hume unworthily asserts; it was the composed and deliberate
communication of a dying captain and sovereign, disclosing to those
around him, under a strong sentiment of devotion, a secret of that
kingly office which he was then on the point of relinquishing for
ever. To enter upon an appreciation of the moral value of the
enterprise which Henry had then in prospect, would be as much out of
place here, as it would be absurd to estimate it by the rule of the
present age. In those ages, when all the higher orders of society
were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page317" name="page317">(p. 317)</a></span>
either clerical or martial, much real piety of
sentiment must, in innumerable instances, have been compounded with
the widely-extended romantic spirit which was ardent to hazard life on
sacred ground of Judea, rather than to suffer the continuance of its
profanation by the avowed enemy of the Christian name.</p>

<p>"The establishment of this point, certifying, as it does an
interesting fact hitherto unknown, and effectually repelling and
exposing an unjustifiable sarcasm directed against one of the most
illustrious princes that have graced the English crown, may acquire in
the history of truth the importance to which it might not be able to
lay claim in the political history of a
people."<a id="notetag245" name="notetag245"></a><a href="#note245">[245]</a></p>

<p>In dismissing the immediate subject of this inquiry, the Author of
these Memoirs feels himself under the painful necessity of recording
his deliberate judgment on the inaccuracies of that celebrated writer,
whose reflections upon Henry's dying declaration
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page318" name="page318">(p. 318)</a></span>
have been
animadverted upon here. Through the whole series of years to the
events of which these Memoirs are chiefly limited, he has been able to
find very few transactions in recording or commenting upon which Hume
has not been guilty of error; whilst the mistakes into which he has
fallen (some more, some less, gravely affecting the character of an
historian,) are generally such as an examination of the best evidence,
conducted with ordinary care, would have enabled him successfully to
avoid. Hume, unfortunately, supplied himself without stint from the
stream after it had mingled with many turbid and discolouring waters.
To draw, in each case of doubt and difficulty, from the well-head of
historical truth, would have exacted more time and labour than he was
ready to bestow. Had he prescribed to himself a system of research the
very opposite to that in which he unhappily indulged, instead of
representing Henry of Monmouth to have left the world with the
falsehood of a self-deceiver on his tongue, he would have been
compelled to record him as a man of piety, mercy, and truth.</p>

<p>In estimating the character of an individual, nothing is more
calculated to mislead ourselves, or to subject him to injustice at our
hands, than a disregard of the time, and country, and circumstances in
which he lived. It is equally unwise, and unfair, and deceitful, for a
human judge to establish one fixed
standard<a id="notetag246" name="notetag246"></a><a href="#note246">[246]</a>
of excellence in any
department whatever of scientific or practical knowledge, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page320" name="page320">(p. 320)</a></span>
then to try the merits of all persons alike with reference to
that one test. The injustice and absurdity of estimating the talents
for investigation and acumen, the skill, and industry, and
perseverance of a chemical student, many centuries ago, by the
knowledge of the most celebrated men of the present day, and to
pronounce all who fell below that standard to have been deficient in
natural talents, or in a faithful exercise of them, would be seen and
acknowledged by all. At this time, errors in navigation would be
unpardonable, which would have implicated a pilot in no culpability at
all, who lived before the invention of the mariner's compass, and when
half our globe was as yet unknown. The same observations are
applicable when we would estimate the moral excellence of an
individual, his worth in a private or a public capacity, his character
as a subject or a governor,&mdash;as the framer, or the guardian, or the
administrator of the laws. Many a practice in ordinary social
intercourse, which would not be tolerated, and would fix a stigma on
those who were examples of it as persons to be shunned and excluded
from society in one age or country, might in another not only be
endured, but be even countenanced and encouraged by those who would
take the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page321" name="page321">(p. 321)</a></span>
lead in the improvement and refinement of civilized
life. The grand broad fundamental principles of right and wrong must
abstractedly be acknowledged always and in every place; but in the
interpretation<a id="notetag247" name="notetag247"></a><a href="#note247">[247]</a>
of them, and in their practical application, we
shall find in the records of successive ages every conceivable
diversity. If, in these days, we are tempted to brand with the mark of
ignorance, and superstition, and cruelty, those among our predecessors
who enacted laws against witchcraft, and condemned to death those who
were found guilty of dealings with the spirit of wickedness, we must
at the same time remember that persons who are examples of every
Christian excellence, of reverence for God's law, of justice and
charity, are now engaged in occupations which those men held in
abhorrence. They believed in the reality of witchcraft, and condemned
those who were pronounced guilty of the crime; we believe that the
crime cannot be committed, that it is merely a creature of the
imagination, and we denominate those who pretend to the power of
committing it impostors: just as by the Mosaic law they were condemned
as deceivers, pretending to possess a power and knowledge
independently of the Almighty.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page322" name="page322">(p. 322)</a></span>
Our predecessors considered
the lending of money upon interest as an offence against the law of
God, and reprobated those who so employed their capital as usurers,
who had forfeited all title to the name of merciful
Christians;&mdash;whilst in the present day the most scrupulous person does
not hesitate, as in a matter of conscience, to depend for the means of
subsistence on such a source of income. Assuming that in each of these
two cases our views are formed on a sounder principle of moral and
religious philosophy, we have no more right to disparage the character
of any individual, who did his best in the midst of less favourable
circumstances, than we should have to reprobate the helmsman of former
days, because in the darkness of a starless night he had no compass
wherewith to save his ship from wreck.</p>

<p>These principles must be borne in mind, and acted upon whenever we
would examine the spirit and character of any individual on the charge
of superstition, bigotry, cruelty, and unchristian persecution. Had
not these principles unhappily been laid aside for a time and
forgotten, we should scarcely have been pained by so severe a portrait
of Henry of Monmouth, as a writer who ought to have known better has
drawn, not in the warmth of debate and the hurry of controversy, but
in the hour of reflection and quietude. "In the midst of these
tragedies died Henry V, whose military greatness is known to most
readers. His vast capacity
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page323" name="page323">(p. 323)</a></span>
and talents for government have
been also justly celebrated. But what is man without the genuine fear
of God? This monarch, in the former part of his life, was remarkable
for dissipation and extravagance of conduct; in the latter he became
the slave of the
popedom,<a id="notetag248" name="notetag248"></a><a href="#note248">[248]</a>
and for that reason was called the
Prince of Priests. Voluptuousness, ambition, superstition, each in
their turn, had the ascendant in this extraordinary character. Such,
however, is the dazzling nature of personal bravery and of prosperity,
that even the ignorance and folly of the bigot, and the barbarities of
the persecutor, are lost or forgotten amidst the enterprises of the
hero and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page324" name="page324">(p. 324)</a></span>
the successes of the conqueror. Reason and justice
lift up their voice in vain. The great and substantial defects of
Henry V. must hardly be touched on by Englishmen. The battle of
Agincourt throws a delusive splendour around the name of this
victorious King."<a id="notetag249" name="notetag249"></a><a href="#note249">[249]</a></p>

<p>It is very painful to read this sentence; but the historian and
biographer must not be driven by such sweeping condemnation into the
opposite extreme; nor be deterred by the apprehension of unpopularity
from laying open his views both of the moral and religious question in
the abstract, and also of the acts, and character, and spirit of the
individual subject of inquiry.</p>

<p>The principles of religious liberty were ill understood through many
years before, and subsequently to, the time of Henry V. The sentiments
of persons in every rank of life in those days seem to have been built
upon an understanding, that the authorities, ecclesiastical and civil,
were bound in duty to expel heresy by force. It was not the case of a
dominant party enacting penalties abhorrent from the sympathies of the
mass of the people; "the people themselves wished to have it so, and
the priests bore rule by their means." So thorough a triumph had the
gigantic policy of Rome achieved over the freedom, and the wills, and
the judgments of the inhabitants of Europe! Like her other victories,
this too was the work of progressive
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page325" name="page325">(p. 325)</a></span>
inroads on the
liberties of Christians. Never at rest, ever active, the
arch-conqueror fastened to her chariot-wheels, one by one, the most
valued rights and most solemn duties of responsible agents. The right
of private judgment in matters of religion had been resigned by the
vast majority of the people of Christendom, and the duty and
responsibility in each individual of searching for the truth himself
had been laid aside long before Henry V. was called to take a part in
the affairs of this world. Bold and noble spirits, indeed, were found
in successive periods to assert their own rights and to declare the
privileges and the duties of their fellow-creatures, and to think for
themselves in a matter which so deeply involved their own individual
and eternal welfare; whilst the bulk of mankind in Christendom not
only resigned their faith to the absolute control of the priesthood,
but exacted also from their fellow-citizens a similar surrender, on
pain of losing their share in the protection and advantages of the
state. Thus had heresy, in various nations of Europe, become
synonymous with rebellion and treason; a rejection of the
determinations of the church in matters of doctrine was identified in
most men's minds with rejection of the authority of the civil
magistrate;<a id="notetag250" name="notetag250"></a><a href="#note250">[250]</a>
and every one who dared to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page326" name="page326">(p. 326)</a></span>
dispute the
jurisdiction of Rome was regarded as a dangerous innovator, and an
enemy to his own country.</p>

<p>That this was a state of things to be deplored by every friend of
liberty and lover of truth, is not questioned; that domination over
the consciences of men has ever been the object of the church of Rome,
and that the spirit of persecution will ever be characteristic of her
principles, is not here denied; nor are these observations made for
the purpose of softening the feelings of abhorrence with which any
persons may be disposed to view the proceedings of a persecuting
spirit in those things which concern our most momentous interests so
awfully. We refer to these historical reminiscences solely for the
purpose of forming a more correct estimate of the individual character
of one who lived in those times, and was born, and cradled, and
educated in that atmosphere. It is easy to charge Henry V. with "the
ignorance and folly of the bigot, and the barbarities of the
persecutor;" but it were more worthy of a historian (his eye bent
singly on the truth) to substitute inquiry
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page327" name="page327">(p. 327)</a></span>
for assumption,
and careful weighing of the evidence for indiscriminate condemnation.
There is such a thing as persecution, though the dungeon and the stake
be not employed for its instruments; and true charity will be tender
of the character of a fellow-mortal, though he is removed from this
scene of trouble and trial, and has no longer the power of answering
the accusations with which his good name is assailed. We may be as
honest as those who write most bitterly, in our abhorrence of
persecution; and yet think the individual who put its most rigid laws
into effect, deserving of compassion and pity that his lot had fallen
in such days of bigotry and ignorance, rather than of reprobation for
not having discovered for himself a more enlightened path of duty.</p>

<p>It is not because we are obliged to confess that even the outward acts
of Henry V. have been those of a persecutor, that these preliminary
remarks are offered; it is rather to prepare our minds for a fair
examination of his conduct, with reference to the only just and equal
standard; for a candid and searching analysis of the evidence drawn
from original sources, before it has become turbid and coloured by the
channel through which it is often forced to flow; and for an
unprejudiced judgment on his character,&mdash;a judgment perverted neither,
on the one hand, by the dazzling splendour of his victories, nor, on
the other, by that very common but most
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page328" name="page328">(p. 328)</a></span>
iniquitous principle
of adjudication condemns the accused from hatred of the crime laid to
his charge. The Author's sentiments on the character of religious
persecution in general, and of the persecuting spirit of the church of
Rome in particular, need not be disguised. He would never be disposed
to acquit Henry V, or any other person, from a feeling of sympathy
with the spirit of persecution.</p>

<p>The religion of the Gospel abhors all persecution. The faith of Christ
must be maintained and propagated by more holy and heavenly weapons
than those which can be forged by human authority and power.
Persecution prevails in a Christian community only so far as the
genuine spirit of the Gospel is quenched or checked among its members.
The church has a power of compelling men to come to Christ, and to
embrace the true faith, but its instruments of compulsion must be
spiritual only: its sword must be supplied from God's own armoury. The
sentence, "Having the terrors of the Lord, we persuade men," conveys
an idea of tremendous consequences in store for those who refuse to
obey the truth; but the consequences are reserved for the immediate
dispensation of Him "who knoweth the thoughts." That believers, when
possessed of temporal power, should have recourse to bodily restraint,
and torture, and death, as the earthly punishment of those who
entertain unsound doctrine, is a monstrous invention,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page329" name="page329">(p. 329)</a></span> which
can derive no countenance from "the Word," and must be supported only
by a worldly sword, and the arm of man wielding it. If, indeed,
Christians are so far forgetful of the spirit of the Gospel as, on the
plea of defending and spreading its genuine doctrines, to disturb the
peace, and shake the foundations, and threaten the overthrow of
society, the civil magistrate, whether Christian or heathen, will
interpose. But neither has he, more than the church, any authority
whatever for interfering by violence with the faith of any one. It is
the duty of a Christian magistrate to provide for his people the means
of religious instruction, and worship, and consolation; but, on the
principles which alone can be justified, he must leave them at liberty
to reject or to avail themselves of the benefit. Their neglect, or
their abuse of it, will form a subject of inquiry at another tribunal;
and the final, irreversible judgment to be pronounced there, man has
no right to anticipate by pain and punishment on earth. These are the
true principles of Christianity, and a church departs from the Gospel
whenever these principles are neglected.</p>

<p>In adopting, however, these principles, and making them practically
one's own, it must never be forgotten that there is a danger of
confounding them, as they are unhappily too often confounded, with the
results of a philosophy, falsely so called, which would teach
governments to be indifferent to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page330" name="page330">(p. 330)</a></span>
the religion of their
people, and would encourage individuals to take no interest in the
dissemination of religious truth. East is not more opposed to west,
than the spirit of persecution, which would compel others by secular
punishments to make profession of whatever doctrines the government of
a country may adopt, is opposed to that Christian wisdom which
maintains it to be equally the bounden duty of the state to provide
for the religious instruction and comfort of its members, as it is the
duty of a father to train up his own children in the faith and fear of
God. The poles are not further asunder, than that holy anxiety for the
salvation of our fellow-creatures which would impel Christians, to the
very utmost bound of the sphere of their influence, to promote as well
unity in the faith as the bond of peace and righteousness of life, is
removed from that narrow bigotry which fixes on those who differ from
ourselves the charge of wilful blindness, and obstinate hatred of the
truth, to be visited by man's rebuke here, and God's displeasure for
ever.<a id="notetag251" name="notetag251"></a><a href="#note251">[251]</a>
A wise and pious writer of our own
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page331" name="page331">(p. 331)</a></span>
has
said,<a id="notetag252" name="notetag252"></a><a href="#note252">[252]</a>
"Show me the man who would desire to travel to heaven alone,
regardless of his fellow-creature's progress thitherward, and in that
same person I will show you one who will never be admitted there." The
principle applies equally to an individual and a commonwealth. Show me
a State which neglects to provide for the spiritual edification and
comfort of its members, and in its institutions proves itself
unconcerned as to the advancement of religious truth, and in that
State you see a commonwealth whose counsels are not guided by the
spirit of the Gospel, and therefore on which, however for a time it
may shine and dazzle men's eyes with the splendour of conquest, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page332" name="page332">(p. 332)</a></span>
be making gigantic strides in secular aggrandizement, the
blessing of the God of Truth and Love cannot be expected to descend.</p>

<p>A Christian legislature is bound by the most solemn of all
obligations to supply with parental care the means which, in the
honest exercise of its wisdom, it deems best fitted for converting the
community into a people serving God; each obedient to his law here,
each personally preparing for the awful change from time to eternity.
But with each individual member of the community, from those who make
its laws or administer them to the humblest labourer for his daily
bread, it must ultimately be left to accept or to reject, to cultivate
or neglect, the offered blessing. The moment compulsion interferes
with the free choice of the individual, the religion of the heart and
the outward observance cease to coincide, and hypocrisy, not faith
working by love, is the result.
"Persecution<a id="notetag253" name="notetag253"></a><a href="#note253">[253]</a>
either punishes a
man for keeping a good conscience, or forces him into a bad
conscience; it either punishes sincerity, or persuades hypocrisy; it
persecutes a truth, or drives into error; and it teaches a man to
dissemble and to be safe, but never to be honest."</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>With these observations we would proceed to inquire historically into
the personal character of Henry V. with regard to religious
persecution; a prince
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page333" name="page333">(p. 333)</a></span>
who lived when all Christendom was
full of the darkness of bigotry and superstition, and when persecution
had established its "cruel habitations" in every corner of the land.</p>

<p>The first occasion on which Henry of Monmouth's name is in any way
connected with religious intolerance and persecution, is recorded in
the Rolls of Parliament, 7 and 8 Henry IV. The circumstance is thus
stated by
Prynne,<a id="notetag254" name="notetag254"></a><a href="#note254">[254]</a>
or whoever was the author of the passage which
is now found in the "Abridgment of Records in the Tower." "At this
time the clergy suborned Henry, Prince, for and in the name of the
clergy, and Sir John Tibetott the Speaker, for and in behalf of the
Commons, to exhibit a long and <i>bloody</i> bill against certain men
called Lollards,&mdash;namely, against them that taught or preached
anything against the temporal livings of the clergy. Other points
touching Lollardy I read none; only this is to be marked, for the
better expedition in this exploit, they joined prophecies touching the
King's <span class="pagenum"><a id="page334" name="page334">(p. 334)</a></span>
estate, and such as whispered and bruited that King
Richard should be living; the which they inserted, to the end that by
the same subtlety they might the better achieve against the poor
Lollards aforesaid. Wherein note a most unlawful and monstrous
tyranny; for the request of the same bill was, that every officer, or
other minister whatever might apprehend and inquire of such Lollards
without any other commission, and that no sanctuary should hold them."</p>

<p>The Biographer of Henry V. needs not be very anxious as to the real
intention of this petition. The allegation that Prince Henry and the
Speaker of the House of Commons were suborned by the clergy, is a pure
invention; no proof, or probable confirmation of any part of the
charge, is afforded by history. The Speaker is named as the chief
member of the House of Commons; the Prince is named as President of
the Council, and chief member of the House of Lords; each acting in
his official rather than in his individual character.</p>

<p>The petition was presented on Wednesday, December 22, in the
parliament 7 and 8 Henry IV. which was dissolved that same day. The
Roll records that "The Commons came before the King and Lords, and
prayed an interview with the Lords by John Tybetot the Speaker."
Different petitions were presented; one touching the succession of the
crown, and the petition in question. The petition is not drawn up in
the name of the Commons and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page335" name="page335">(p. 335)</a></span>
Lords; it purports to be
addressed to the King by "his humble son Henry the Prince, and the
Lords Spiritual and Temporal in this present parliament assembled;"
and the Speaker, in the name of the Commons, prays the King that the
petition might be made the law of the land until the next parliament:
and the King "graciously assents." Whatever were the real object of
this law, if its aim were merciful, the Prince ought to have no
additional share of the praise; if it were adding to the severity of
the existing law, he deserves no additional blame, from the fact of
his name appearing in the petition. In either case it appears there
just as the Speaker's does, officially. But what was the real drift of
this petition? Suppose it to have been on the side of severity, will
it deserve the character assigned to it by the author of the
"Abridgment?" Can it be called a "bloody" petition? It prayed that
after the feast of Epiphany next ensuing, without any other
commission, "Lollards, and other speakers and contrivers of news and
lies, <i>might be apprehended</i> and <i>kept in safe custody till the next
parliament</i>, and <i>there to answer to the charges against them</i>."
Suppose this to have been an extension of a former persecuting law, it
gave no power of life or death, or any further severity against the
person, than merely safe custody, a power now given to any magistrate
against persons accused of any one of a large class of offences
usually treated as light and trifling. But we may suppose that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page336" name="page336">(p. 336)</a></span>
the real bearing of this petition were altogether the other
way,&mdash;that it was intended to mitigate the severity of the existing
law,&mdash;to deprive the real persecutors of the power, which they would
undoubtedly have had, "of citing the suspected heretic, punishing him
by fine and imprisonment, and, in the case of a relapsed or obstinate
heretic, consigning him to the civil power for death." This power the
statute<a id="notetag255" name="notetag255"></a><a href="#note255">[255]</a>
2 Hen. IV. c. 15, conferred on the diocesans; and the
petition in question might have been virtually a suspension of that
sanguinary law till the next session. If this be so, we have precluded
ourselves from ascribing any individual merit to Henry of Monmouth
above the rest of the peers who drew up the petition; but he must
share it equally with them; at all events, the charge of his having
been suborned by the clergy to present "a long and bloody petition"
falls to the ground. On this question, however, it were better to cite
the opinion
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page337" name="page337">(p. 337)</a></span>
of an author certainly able to take a correct
view of such subjects; and who, not having Henry the Fifth's character
before him at the time, but only the historical fact, must be regarded
as an unprejudiced authority. Mr.
Hallam,<a id="notetag256" name="notetag256"></a><a href="#note256">[256]</a>
in his History of the
Middle Ages, makes this comment upon the proceeding in question. "We
find a remarkable
petition<a id="notetag257" name="notetag257"></a><a href="#note257">[257]</a>
in 8 Henry IV. professedly aimed
against the Lollards, but intended, as I strongly suspect, in their
favour. It condemns persons preaching against the Catholic faith or
sacraments to imprisonment against the next parliament, where they
were to abide such judgment as should be rendered by <i>the King and
peers of the realm</i>. This seems to supersede the burning statute of 2
Henry IV, and the spiritual cognizance of heresy. Rot. Parl. p. 583;
see too p. 626. The petition was expressly granted; but the clergy, I
suppose, prevented its appearing in the
Roll."<a id="notetag258" name="notetag258"></a><a href="#note258">[258]</a>
Certain it is,
that, unless the statute framed upon this petition suspended the power
of the existing law, the hierarchy had full authority, without the
intervention of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page338" name="page338">(p. 338)</a></span>
the civil magistrate, to apprehend any one
suspected of heresy, to try him, to sentence him, and to deliver him
over to the secular power for death, upon receipt of the King's
writ.<a id="notetag259" name="notetag259"></a><a href="#note259">[259]</a>
Certain it also is, that, on those who might be apprehended
in consequence of this petition, none of those rigours could be
visited: on the contrary, they would be placed beyond reach of the
ecclesiastical arm. Surely to talk of Prince Henry being suborned by
the priests to present a bloody petition, savours rather of blind
prejudice than of upright judgment.</p>

<p>The only other occasion which places Henry of Monmouth, whilst Prince
of Wales, before us in conjunction with bigotry, intolerance, and
persecution, is the martyrdom of a condemned heretic, executed in
Smithfield. Fox, and those who follow him, say, that the martyr was
John Badby, an artificer of Worcester, condemned first in his own
county, and then definitively sentenced by the Archbishop, the Duke of
York, the Chancellor, and others in London; the Chronicle of London
records the same transaction, but speaks of the individual as a
"<i>clerk</i>, who believed nought of the sacrament of the altar!" There is
no doubt, however, that the two accounts, as well as the Archbishop's
record, refer to the same individual, though the Chronicle of London
is mistaken as to the sphere of life in which he moved. It will be
borne in mind that the question is not, whether John Badby ended his
life gloriously in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page339" name="page339">(p. 339)</a></span>
defence and in testimony of the truth,
nor whether those who charged, and tried, and condemned him, were
merciless persecutors; the only point of inquiry immediately before us
is, Whether, at the death of John Badby, Henry of Monmouth showed
himself to be a persecutor. The circumstances, however, of this
martyr's charge and condemnation, independently of that question, are
by no means void of interest; though our plan precludes us from
detailing them further than they may throw more or less direct light
upon the subject of our investigation. The following statement is
taken from Archbishop Arundel's
record.<a id="notetag260" name="notetag260"></a><a href="#note260">[260]</a></p>

<p class="p2">

<p>John Badby was an inhabitant of Evesham, in the diocese of Worcester,
and by trade a tailor. He was charged before the bishop with heresy,
and was condemned in the diocesan court. The point on which alone his
persecutors charged him, was his denial of transubstantiation. His
trial took place on the 2nd of January, 1409, and he was subsequently
brought before the Archbishop and his court in London, as a heretic
convict. His examination began on Saturday, the 1st of March 1410, at
the close of which the court resolved that he should be kept a close
prisoner till the next Wednesday, in the house of the Preaching
Friars, where the proceedings were carried on. The Archbishop, for
greater caution, said that he would himself
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page340" name="page340">(p. 340)</a></span>
keep possession
of the key. When the Wednesday arrived, the Archbishop took, as his
advisers and assistants, so great a number of the bishops and nobles
of the land, that (in the words of his own record) it would be a task
to enumerate them: among others, however, the names of Edmund Duke of
York, John Earl of Westmoreland, Thomas Beaufort Chancellor of
England, and Lord Beaumond, are
recorded.<a id="notetag261" name="notetag261"></a><a href="#note261">[261]</a>
Prince Henry, though
present in London, and actively engaged with some of the same noblemen
as members of the council, was not present at Badby's examination,
either on the Saturday or on the
Wednesday.<a id="notetag262" name="notetag262"></a><a href="#note262">[262]</a>
In all his
examinations Badby seems to have conducted himself throughout with
great firmness and self-possession, and, at the same time, with much
respect towards those who were then his judges. Looking to the
circumstances in which he was placed, it is almost impossible for any
one not to be struck by the weight and pointedness of his answers. He
openly professed his belief in the ever blessed Trinity, "one
omnipotent God in Trinity;" and when pressed as to his belief in the
sacrament of the altar,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page341" name="page341">(p. 341)</a></span>
he declared that, after consecration,
the elements were signs of Christ's body, but he could not believe
that they were changed into the substance of his flesh and blood.
"If," he said, "a priest can by his word make God, there will be
twenty thousand Gods in England at one time. Moreover, I cannot
conceive how, when Christ at his last supper broke one piece of bread,
and gave a portion to each of his disciples, the piece of bread could
remain whole and entire as before, or that he then held his own body
in his hand." At his last appearance before the large assemblage of
the hierarchy and the temporality, when asked as to the nature of the
elements, he said, that "in the sight of God, the Duke of York, or any
child of Adam, was of higher value than the sacrament of the altar."
The Archbishop declared openly to the accused that, if he would live
according to the doctrine of Christ, he would pledge his soul for him
at the last judgment day.</p>

<p>The registrar, in recording these proceedings, employs expressions
which too plainly indicate the frame of mind with which this poor man
was viewed by his persecutors. Had the words been attributed either to
the Archbishop himself, or to his remembrancer, by an enemy, they
might have excited a suspicion of misrepresentation or
misunderstanding. "Whilst he was under examination the poison of asps
appeared about his lips; for a very large spider, which no one saw
enter, suddenly and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page342" name="page342">(p. 342)</a></span>
unexpectedly, in the sight of all, ran
about his face." To this absurd statement, however, the registrar adds
a sentence abounding with painful and dreadful associations. "The
Archbishop, weighing in his mind that the Holy Spirit was not in the
man at all, and seeing by his unsubdued countenance that he had a
heart hardened like Pharaoh's, freeing themselves from him altogether,
delivered him to the secular arm; praying the noblemen who were
present, not to put him to death for his offence, nor deliver him to
be punished." Whatever force this prayer of the hierarchy was expected
to have, the King's writ was ready. The Archbishop condemned him
before their early dinner, and forthwith on the same day, after
dinner, he was taken to Smithfield, and burnt in a sort of tub to
ashes. The Lambeth
Register<a id="notetag263" name="notetag263"></a><a href="#note263">[263]</a>
mentions the mode of his death, and
affirms that he persevered in his obstinacy to the last, but says
nothing whatever about the Prince of Wales. The further proceedings
with regard to this martyr, and which connect him with the subject of
these Memoirs, are thus stated by Fox, in his Book of Martyrs.</p>

<p class="letter">
     "This
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page343" name="page343">(p. 343)</a></span>
thing<a id="notetag264" name="notetag264"></a><a href="#note264">[264]</a>
[the condemnation by the Archbishop,
     and the delivery of Badby to the secular power,] being done and
     concluded in the forenoon, in the afternoon the King's writ was
     not far behind; by the force whereof John Badby was brought into
     Smithfield, and there, being put into an empty barrel, was bound
     with iron chains, fastened to a stake, having dry wood put about
     him. And as he was thus standing in the pipe or tun, (for as yet
     Perilous' bull was not in use among the bishops,) it happened
     that the Prince, the King's eldest son, was there present; who,
     showing some part of the good Samaritan, <i>began to endeavour and
     assay how to save the life of him</i> whom the hypocritical Levites
     and Pharisees sought to put to death. <i>He admonished and
     counselled him that, having respect unto himself he should
     speedily withdraw himself out of these labyrinths of opinions</i>;
     adding oftentimes threatenings, the which would have daunted any
     man's stomach. Also Courtney, at that time Chancellor of Oxford,
     preached unto him, and informed him of the faith of holy church.
     In this mean season, the Prior of St. Bartlemew's in Smithfield,
     brought, with all solemnity, the sacrament of God's body, with
     twelve torches borne before, and so shewed the sacrament to the
     poor man being at the stake: and then they demanded
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page344" name="page344">(p. 344)</a></span> of
     him how he believed in it; he answered, that he well knew it was
     hallowed bread, and not God's body. And then was the tunne put
     over him, and fire put unto him. And when he felt the fire he
     cried, 'Mercy!' (calling belike upon the Lord,) and so the Prince
     immediately commanded to take away the tun and quench the fire.
     The Prince, his commandment being done, asked him if he would
     forsake heresy and take him to the faith of holy church; which
     thing if he would do, he should have goods enough: promising also
     unto him a yearly stipend out of the King's treasury, so much as
     would suffice his contentation. But this valiant champion of
     Christ rejected the Prince's fair words, as also contemned all
     men's devices, and refused the offer of worldly promises, no
     doubt but being more vehemently inflamed with the spirit of God
     than with earthly desire. Wherefore, when as yet he continued
     unmoveable in his former mind, the Prince commanded him straight
     to be put again into the pipe or tun, and that he should not
     afterwards look for any grace or favour."
</p>

<p>Milner having told us, that "the memory of Henry is by no means free
from the imputation of cruelty," gives an unfavourable turn to the
whole affair, and ascribes a state of mind to the Prince, which Fox's
account will scarcely justify. Milner's zeal against popery and its
persecutions, often betrays him into expressions which a calm review
of all the circumstances of the case would, probably, have suggested
to his own mind the necessity of modifying and softening. Fox
attributes to Henry "some part of the good Samaritan," and puts most
prominently forward his desire and endeavour
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page345" name="page345">(p. 345)</a></span>
to save the
poor man's life. Milner ascribes to him a violence of temper,
altogether unbecoming the melancholy circumstances of that hour of
death, and directs our thoughts chiefly to his attempt to force a
conscientious man to recant.</p>

<p>The account of Milner is this: "After he, Badby, had been delivered to
the secular power by the Bishops, he was by the King's writ condemned
to be burned. The Prince of Wales, happening to be present, very
earnestly exhorted him to recant, adding the most terrible menaces of
the vengeance that would overtake him if he should continue in his
obstinacy. Badby, however, was inflexible. As soon as he felt the
fire, he cried 'Mercy!' The Prince, supposing he was entreating the
mercy of his judges, ordered the fire to be quenched. 'Will you
forsake heresy,' said young Henry, 'and will you conform to the faith
of the holy church? If you will, you shall have a yearly stipend out
of the King's treasury?' The martyr was unmoved, and Henry <span class="smcap">in a rage</span>
declared that he might now look for no favour. Badby gloriously
finished his course in the flames."</p>

<p>The Chronicle of London, from which, in all probability, Fox drew the
materials for his description, makes one shudder at the reckless,
cold-blooded acquiescence of its author in the excruciating tortures
of a fellow-creature suffering for his faith's sake. In his eyes,
heretics were detestable pests;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page346" name="page346">(p. 346)</a></span>
and an abhorrence of heresy
seems to have quenched every feeling of humanity in his heart. It must
be observed, that this contemporary document speaks not a word of
Henry having been "in a rage," nor of his having commanded the
sufferer to be "straight put into the ton," nor of his having used
"horrible menaces of vengeance," nor, even in the milder expression of
Fox, "threatenings which would have daunted any man's stomach."</p>

<p class="smsize">
"A clerk," (says the Chronicle,) "that believed nought of the
sacrament of the altar, that is to say, God's body, was condemned and
brought to Smithfield to be burnt. And Henry, Prince of Wales, then
the King's eldest son, counselled him to forsake his heresy and hold
the right way of holy church. And the Prior of St. Bartholomew's
brought the holy sacrament of God's body with twelve torches lighted
before, and in this wise came to this cursed heretic; and it was asked
him how he believed, and he answered that he believed well that it was
hallowed bread, and nought God's body. And then was the tonne put over
him, and fire kindled therein; and when the wretch felt the fire he
cried mercy, and anon the Prince commanded to take away the ton and to
quench the fire. And then the Prince asked him if he would forsake his
heresy, and take him to the faith of holy church; which if he would
have done, he should have his life, and goods enough to live by; and
the cursed shrew would not, but continued forth in his heresy:
wherefore he was
burnt."<a id="notetag265" name="notetag265"></a><a href="#note265">[265]</a>
</p>

<p>There
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page347" name="page347">(p. 347)</a></span>
probably will not be great diversity of opinion as to
the conduct of Henry, and the spirit which influenced him on this
occasion. He was present at the execution of a fellow-creature, who
was condemned to an excruciating death by the blind and cruel, but
still by the undoubted law of his country. Acting the "part of the
good Samaritan," he earnestly endeavoured to withdraw him from those
sentiments the publication of which had made him obnoxious to the law;
and he employed the means which his high station afforded him of
suspending the King's writ even at the very moment of its execution,
promising the offender pardon on his princely word, and a full
maintenance for his life. He could do no more: his humanity had
carried him even then beyond his authority, and, considering all the
circumstances, even beyond the line of discretion; and, when he found
that all his efforts were in vain, he left the law to take its own
course,&mdash;a law which had been passed and put in execution before he
had anything whatever to do with legislation and government.</p>

<p>The death of Sir John Oldcastle, Lord Cobham, and the circumstances
which preceded it, require a more patient and a more impartial
examination than they have often met with. But it must be borne in
mind throughout that our inquiry has for its object, neither the
condemnation of religious persecution, nor the palliation of the
spirit of Romanism,&mdash;neither the canonization of the Protestant
martyr, nor the indiscriminate inculpation of all concerned in the sad
tragedy of his condemnation and death,&mdash;but the real estimate of
Henry's character. The pursuit of this inquiry of necessity
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page349" name="page349">(p. 349)</a></span>
leads us through passages in the history of our country, and of our
church, which must be of deep and lively interest to every Englishman
and every Christian. It is impossible, as we proceed, not to fix our
eyes upon objects somewhat removed from the direct road along which we
are passing, and, contemplating the state of things as they were in
those days, contrast them fairly and thankfully with what is our own
lot now.</p>

<p>It were a far easier work to assume that all who were engaged in
prosecuting Sir John Oldcastle were men of heartless bigotry,
unrelenting enemies to true religion, devoid of every principle of
Gospel charity, men of Belial, delighting in deeds of violence and
blood; and that the victim of their cruelty, persecuted even to the
death solely for his religious sentiments, was a pattern of every
Christian excellence, the undaunted champion of Gospel truth, the
sainted martyr of the Protestant faith. This were the more easy task,
for little further would need to be done in its accomplishment than to
select from former writers passages of indiscriminate panegyric on the
one hand, and equally indiscriminate vituperation on the other. The
investigation of doubtful and disputed facts, to the generality of
minds, is irksome and disagreeable; and its results, for the most part
removed, as they are, from extreme opinions on either side, are
received with a far less keen relish than the glowing eulogy of a
partisan, and the unsparing invective of an enemy.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page350" name="page350">(p. 350)</a></span> Truth,
nevertheless, must be our object. Truth is a treasure of intrinsic
value, and will retain its worth after the adventitious and forced
estimate put upon party views and popular representations shall have
passed away.</p>

<p>Sir John Oldcastle, who derived the title of Lord Cobham from his
wife, was a man of great military talents and prowess, and at the same
time a man of piety and zeal for the general good. He was one of the
chief benefactors towards the new bridge at Rochester, a work then
considered of great public importance; and he founded a chantry for
the maintenance of three chaplains. Oldcastle was by no means free
from trouble during the reign of Richard II. Indeed, so unsettled was
the government, and so violent were the measures adopted against
political opponents, and so cheap and vile was human life held, that
few could reckon upon security of property or person for an hour. One
day a man was seen in a high civil or military station; the next
arrested, imprisoned, banished, or put to death. Oldcastle was very
nearly made an early victim of these violent proceedings. Among the
strong measures to which parliament had recourse about the year 1386,
they appointed fourteen lords to conduct the administration, among
whom was Lord Cobham. Just ten years afterwards he was arrested, and
adjudged to death by the
parliament;<a id="notetag266" name="notetag266"></a><a href="#note266">[266]</a>
but his punishment, at the
earnest request
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page351" name="page351">(p. 351)</a></span>
of certain lords, was commuted for perpetual
imprisonment,<a id="notetag267" name="notetag267"></a><a href="#note267">[267]</a>
a sentence from which the lords of parliament
revolted,&mdash;and he was
exiled.<a id="notetag268" name="notetag268"></a><a href="#note268">[268]</a>
From this banishment he returned
with Henry of Lancaster, and was restored to all his possessions which
had been forfeited. Through the whole reign of Henry IV. we find him
in the King's service in Wales and on the Continent. In a summons for
a general council of prelates, lords, and knights, dated July 21,
1401, occurs the name of John Lord
Cobham.<a id="notetag269" name="notetag269"></a><a href="#note269">[269]</a>
In the Minutes of
Council about the end of August 1404, John Oldcastle is appointed to
keep the castles and towns of the Hay and Brecknock; and when English
auxiliaries were sent to aid the Duke of Burgundy, Oldcastle was among
the officers selected for that successful enterprise. Between the
Prince of Wales and this gallant brother in arms an intimacy was
formed, which existed till the melancholy tissue of events interrupted
their friendship, and ultimately separated them for ever.</p>

<p>We have already seen that Lord Cobham had given proof of a pious as
well as a liberal mind; and his piety showed itself in acts which the
Roman church sanctioned and fostered. He built and endowed a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page352" name="page352">(p. 352)</a></span>
chantry for the maintenance of three chaplains. But he had imbibed a
portion of that spirit which Wickliffe's doctrines had diffused far
and wide through the land; and he not only boldly professed his
principles, but actively engaged in disseminating them. It is very
difficult to ascertain the exact truth as to the tenour and extent of
the religious opinions of the rising sect, and the degree in which
they were political dissenters, aiming at the overthrow of the
existing order of things in the state as well as in the church. Their
enemies, doubtless, have exaggerated their intentions, and have
endeavoured to rob them of all claim to the character of sincere
religious reformers; probably misrepresenting their objects, and
confounding their designs with the plots of those turbulent
spirits<a id="notetag270" name="notetag270"></a><a href="#note270">[270]</a>
who then agitated several countries in Europe; whilst
their friends have denied, perhaps injudiciously, any participation on
their part in seditious and treasonable practices. By the one they
have been condemned as reckless enemies to truth, and order, and
peace; by the other they are exalted into self-devoted confessors and
martyrs; in soundness of faith, integrity of life, and constancy unto
death for the truth's sake, equalling those servants and soldiers of
Christ who in the first ages sealed their belief with their blood. The
truth lies between these extremes:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page353" name="page353">(p. 353)</a></span>
their enemies were
bigoted or self-interested persecutors; but many among themselves, as
a body, in their language, their actions, and their professed
principles, were very far removed from that quiet, patient, peaceable
demeanour which becomes the disciples of the Cross. Doubtless there
were numbers at that time in England possessing their souls in
patience, bewailing the gloom and superstition and tyranny which
through that long night of error overspread their country, and
anxiously but resignedly expecting the dawn of a holier and brighter
day. It is, however, impossible to read the documents of the time
without being convinced, not only that the temporal establishment of
the Church was threatened, but that the civil government had good
grounds for watching with a jealous eye, and repressing with a strong
hand, the violent though ill-digested schemes of change then
prevailing in England. Undoubtedly the hierarchy set all the engines
in motion for the extirpation of Lollardism, as the principles of the
rising sect were called. They felt that their dominion over the minds
of men must cease as soon as the right of private judgment was
generally acknowledged; and they resolved, at whatever cost of charity
and of blood, to maintain the hold over the consciences, the minds,
and the property of their fellow-creatures, which the Church had
devoted so many years of steady, unwearied, undeviating policy to
secure. The real question, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page354" name="page354">(p. 354)</a></span>
point on which every other
question between the Protestant communions and the Church of Rome must
depend, is this: "Have individual Christians a right to test the
doctrines of the Church by the written word of God; or must they
receive with implicit credence whatever the church in communion with
the See of Rome, the only authorized and infallible guardian and
propagator of Gospel truth, decrees and propounds?" All the other
differences, however important in themselves, and practically
essential, must follow the fate of this question. The Romanists are
still aware of this, and are as much alive to it as ever were the most
uncompromising vindicators of their church in the days of Lollardism.
They took their resolution, and it was this: "Come what will come,
this heresy must be put down; the very existence of the Church is
incompatible with this rivalry: either Lollardism must be
extinguished, or it will shake the very foundations of Rome." And,
having taken this resolution, they lost no favourable opportunity of
carrying it into full effect.</p>

<p>Some writers seem to have fixed their thoughts so much on the bold and
ruthless measures adopted, or compassed, by the Church under the house
of Lancaster, as to have left unnoticed their proceedings previously
to Henry IV.'s accession. In 1394, when Richard II. made his first
expedition to Ireland, though he had been absent a very short time, so
alarmed were the heads of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page355" name="page355">(p. 355)</a></span>
Church at the progress of the
new opinions, that the Archbishop of
York<a id="notetag271" name="notetag271"></a><a href="#note271">[271]</a>
and the Bishop of
London went over in person to implore him to return forthwith and put
down the
Lollards,<a id="notetag272" name="notetag272"></a><a href="#note272">[272]</a>
his own and the Church's formidable enemies.
Many strong measures were resorted to on that King's return, but all
short of those deeds of guilt and blood which disgraced our country
through the next reigns. The Pope, the King, and the hierarchy put
forth their united exertions, and for a season the growing danger
seemed to be repressed; but it was still silently and widely
spreading. In the year 1400, before Henry IV. was settled in his
throne, and whilst he was naturally alive to every report of danger,
the several estates of the realm "pray the King to pass such a law as
may effectually rid the kingdom of those plotters against all rule and
right and liberty, (for so are the Lollards described,) whose aim is
to dispossess the clergy of their benefices, the King of his throne,
and the whole realm of tranquillity and order, exciting to the utmost
of their power sedition and insurrection." And in that year was passed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page356" name="page356">(p. 356)</a></span>
the statute De hæretico comburendo, which enacted that a
suspected heretic should be cited by his diocesan, be fined, and
imprisoned; and, if pronounced a relapsed or obstinate heretic, be
given over by the Church to the secular power, to be burnt, in an
elevated spot, before the people, to strike terror the more. It was
under this statute that Sir John Oldcastle was summoned, tried,
adjudged, and delivered to the secular power.</p>

<p>How long he had entertained the new opinions, or, by openly
encouraging their propagators, had incurred the anger, and drawn down
upon himself the concentrated violence of the hierarchy, does not
appear. From one circumstance we may fairly infer, that, whilst he was
aiding the Prince in the war against Owyn Glyndowr, he had not been
silent or idle in the dissemination of these principles. In the synod
held in St. Paul's, his offence of sending emissaries and preachers is
said to have been especially committed (beside the dioceses of London
and Rochester) in the diocese of Hereford; and, as we have seen, in
1404 he was especially charged with the safeguard of the town and
castle of Hay, in Herefordshire: he was also sheriff of that county in
1407. Whether he had ever communicated his sentiments to the Prince,
or not, must remain a matter only of conjecture: be this as it may, no
sooner was the first parliament of Henry V. assembled,&mdash;and they met
soon after Easter,&mdash;than Arundel convened a full
assembly<a id="notetag273" name="notetag273"></a><a href="#note273">[273]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page357" name="page357">(p. 357)</a></span>
of prelates and clergy in St. Paul's
Cathedral.<a id="notetag274" name="notetag274"></a><a href="#note274">[274]</a>
It was there
speedily determined that the breaches in the Church could not be
repaired, nor peace and security restored, unless certain noblemen and
gentry, favourers of Lollardism, were removed, or effectually
silenced, and brought back to their allegiance. Especially, and by
name, was this decree passed against Sir John Oldcastle, Lord Cobham;
and a resolution was taken to proceed against him forthwith. But he
was then in high favour with the King; and the Archbishop thought it
discreet to endeavour first to withdraw from him the royal favour,
before proceeding openly to put the law in force against him. And at
this point our interest in the transactions, and our desire to
ascertain the accuracy of the accounts in every particular begin to
increase; for our estimate of the tone and temper of Henry's mind, and
the real nature of his conduct, will be affected by a very slight
change of expression and turn of thought. Was Henry V. a persecutor
for religious opinions?</p>

<p>Perhaps <span class="pagenum"><a id="page358" name="page358">(p. 358)</a></span>
the more satisfactory course will be, first to give
the statements of Fox, and one or two others, who have taken the view
of the case least favourable to Henry, and then to add the account of
the transaction as it is recorded by the Archbishop, on whose record
Fox informs us that the ground and certainty of his own history of
Lord Cobham depended. Almost all subsequent writers copy the
martyrologist exclusively and implicitly, though often with much
additional colouring.</p>

<p>Fox, who certainly follows the original statement in Archbishop
Arundel's register much more faithfully, than those who have taken
their facts from him, and heightened them by their own exaggerated
colouring, gives an unfavourable and an unfair turn to the whole
proceeding by one or two strokes of his pencil. His version of the
affair is this: "The King <i>gently</i> heard those bloodthirsty prelates,
and <i>far otherwise than became his princely dignity</i>; notwithstanding
requiring, and instantly desiring them, that in respect of his noble
stock and knighthood, they would deal favourably with him, and that
they would, if possible, without all rigour or extreme handling,
reduce him to the Church's unity. He promised them also, that, in case
they were content to take some deliberation, himself would seriously
commune the matter with him. Anon after, the King sent for Lord
Cobham, and, as he was come, he called him, secretly admonishing him,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page359" name="page359">(p. 359)</a></span>
betwixt him and him, to submit himself to his mother the holy
Church, and as an obedient child to acknowledge himself culpable. Unto
whom the Christian knight made this answer: 'You, most worthy prince,
I am always most ready to obey. Unto you, next my eternal God, I owe
whole obedience, and submit thereto, as I have ever done. But as
touching the Pope and his spirituality, I owe them neither suit nor
service; forasmuch as I know him by the Scriptures to be the great
Antichrist, the son of perdition, the open adversary of God, and the
abomination standing in the holy place!' When the King had heard this,
and such like sentences more, he would talk no longer with him, but
left him so utterly. And as the Archbishop resorted again unto him for
an answer, he gave him his full authority to cite him, examine him,
and punish him according to their devilish decrees, which they called
the laws of holy church."</p>

<p>In his comment on the answer said to have been made by Lord Cobham to
the King, Milner's zeal in favour of the accused, betrays him into
expressions against Henry which cannot be justified: "The <i>extreme
ignorance of Henry</i> in matters of religion by no means disposed him to
relish such an answer as this; <i>he immediately turned away from him in
visible displeasure</i>, and gave up the disciple of Wickliff to the
malice of his enemies."</p>

<p>Hall's version is this: "The King, first having compassion
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page360" name="page360">(p. 360)</a></span>
on the nobleman, required the prelates, if he were a strayed
sheep,<a id="notetag275" name="notetag275"></a><a href="#note275">[275]</a>
rather by gentleness than by rigour to bring him back
again to his old flock: after that, he, sending for him, godly
exhorted and lovingly admonished him to reconcile himself to God and
his laws. The Lord Cobham thanked the King for his most favourable
clemency, affirming his grace to be his supreme head and competent
judge, and no other."</p>

<p>The record, as it is found in the Archbishop's Memoirs, is as follows.
Having stated that, of the tracts which had been condemned to the
flames for their heretical contents, one consisting of many smaller
tracts full of more dangerous doctrine, tending to the subversion of
the faith and the church, was found at an illuminator's in Paternoster
Row, who confessed that it was Lord Cobham's, and another was brought
from Coventry, full of poison against the Church of God, the
Archbishop's record thus proceeds: "The day on which the said tracts
were condemned and burnt, certain tracts, containing more important
and more dangerous errors of the said Lord John Oldcastle, were read
before the King, and almost all the prelates and nobles of England, in
the closet of the King at Kennington; the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page361" name="page361">(p. 361)</a></span>
said Lord John
Oldcastle being present and hearing it, having been especially
summoned for this purpose. Then our King himself expressed his
abhorrence of those conclusions, as the worst against the faith and
the church he had ever heard. And the said Lord John Oldcastle, being
asked by the King whether he thought the said tract was justly and
deservedly condemned, said that it was so. On being asked how he could
use or possess a tract of this sort, he said that he had never read
more than two leaves.</p>

<p>"And be it remembered that in the said convocation the said Lord John
Oldcastle was convicted by the whole clergy of the province of
Canterbury, upon his ill-fame for errors and heretical wickedness, and
how in various dioceses he had held, assumed, and defended erroneous
and heretical conclusions; and that he had received to his house,
favoured, refreshed, and defended, chaplains suspected and even
convicted of such errors and heresies, and had sent them off to
different parts of the province to preach and sow this evil seed, to
the subversion of the faith and the state of the
church.<a id="notetag276" name="notetag276"></a><a href="#note276">[276]</a> And
supplication was made on the part of the same clergy to the Lord
Archbishop and the prelates, that the said John
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page362" name="page362">(p. 362)</a></span>
Oldcastle
should be summoned to answer in person to these points. And because it
seemed right to the Lord Archbishop and the prelates, that the King
ought first to be consulted on this point, because he had been his
intimate friend, they waited upon the King at Kennington, and with all
due reverence consulted with him upon the matter. And the King
returned thanks for their obliging kindness, and prayed them,
[regratiabatur benevolentiis eorundem, et eis supplicabat,] for
respect to the King himself, because he had been his intimate friend,
and also from respect to the military order, they would defer process
and execution of every kind against him; promising them that he would
labour, with regard to him, to bring him back with all mildness and
lenity from the error of his way to the right path of truth. And if he
could not succeed in this endeavour, he would deliver him to them
according to the canonical obligations to be punished, and would
assist them in this with all his aid and with the secular arm. And the
said Archbishop and prelates acquiesced in the King's desire, but not
without the dissatisfaction and murmurs of the clergy. Then, after the
lapse of some time, when our said Lord the King had laboured long and
in various ways in the endeavour to bring back the said knight to the
sheepfold of Christ, and had reaped no fruit of his toil, but the
knight continually relapsed into a worse state than before, at length
the King, in the following month of August, being at
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page363" name="page363">(p. 363)</a></span>
Windsor, without further lenity sharply chided the said Lord John for
his obstinacy. And the said Lord, full of the Devil, not enduring such
chiding, withdrew without leave to his castle of Cowling in Kent; and
there fortified himself in the castle, as was publicly reported. After
that, the King sent for the Lord Archbishop, who was then at
Chichester, celebrating the Assumption of the blessed Virgin; and, on
his coming to the King at his house in Windsor Park, the King, after
rehearsing the pains he had taken, enjoined on the Archbishop, and
required him on the part of God and the Church, to proceed with all
expedition against the said Lord John Oldcastle according to the
canonical rules; and then the Archbishop proceeded against him as the
law required."<a id="notetag277" name="notetag277"></a><a href="#note277">[277]</a></p>

<p class="p2">

<p>After attentively perusing this authentic statement, comparing it with
subsequent representations, and recollecting that the utmost which
Henry did was to direct the ecclesiastical authorities to proceed
according <span class="pagenum"><a id="page364" name="page364">(p. 364)</a></span>
to the laws of the land, where he had interrupted
their proceedings with a view of averting the extremities on which
those authorities seemed bent&mdash;and when we learn that even that
temporary delay had called forth the decided disapprobation and
remonstrance of the clergy,&mdash;few probably among unprejudiced minds
will be disposed to view this incident in any other light than as a
proof that Henry, who was a sincere believer, was yet anxious to bring
all to unity in faith and discipline by reason and gentle means, by
the force of argument and persuasion only; and that he earnestly
endeavoured to blunt the edge of the sword with which the law had
supplied the hierarchy, and to avert the horrors of persecution.
Undoubtedly, when he failed, he directed the authorities to proceed
according to law, and assisted them in securing Cobham's person when
he set them at defiance. But it is necessary to take a comprehensive
view of all the circumstances before we pronounce judgment as to his
principles or motives.</p>

<p>The account of Henry's own chaplain, who was prejudiced in the extreme
against the rising sect, seems undoubtedly to imply that in one stage
of the melancholy transaction Henry was more than passive, and
encouraged rather than checked the ecclesiastical authorities to
proceed; but he at the same time adds, what is of course of equal
credit, that the piety of the King deferred the extremity of
punishment and his death. He adds, "that Henry had Oldcastle
committed <span class="pagenum"><a id="page365" name="page365">(p. 365)</a></span>
to the Tower, influenced by the hope that he might
bring him back to the true faith; and that when, towards the end of
October, the straitness of his confinement was softened, and he was,
under promise of renouncing his errors, released from his bond, he
broke prison and escaped." This was written between Oldcastle's escape
and his subsequent capture and death. If we take one part of such
evidence, we must in fairness take the other; and certainly, in that
contemporary's view, Henry was fully determined to do all he could to
save Cobham from the extreme penalty of the law.</p>

<p>He solicited the hierarchy, as a favour to himself, to suspend their
operations for a while; they consented to grant the suspension as a
favour to the King, upon his royal word being pledged that, should he
fail in his endeavours, he would interfere with their proceedings no
further, but on the contrary would assist them. Consistently with his
promise, and with his duty as the chief magistrate of the realm, he
could scarcely have done otherwise than he appears to have done.</p>

<p>After he had put forth his very utmost endeavours to rescue his
subject and friend from the ruin to which the hierarchy had destined
him, he made up his mind that the law should take its course, and that
the accused should be tried as the statute directed. Lord Cobham wrote
a confession of his faith, and, carrying it with him to the court,
presented it to the King; who, having resolved to interpose no
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page366" name="page366">(p. 366)</a></span>
further between the accused and the process of the law, directed
him to present it to his judges: and probably few will be disposed to
think that Henry could act otherwise, consistently with his high
station. The case was now most materially altered; Lord Cobham was in
a very different position, and so was the King. As long as his kind
offices could prevent a public prosecution, Henry spared no personal
labour or time, but zealously devoted himself to this object, though
unsuccessfully. But now the proceedings had advanced almost to their
consummation, and interference at this point could scarcely have been
consistent with the royal duty; especially when we consider what those
proceedings were. Lord Cobham had been summoned to appear before the
spiritual court, had disobeyed the citation, had been pronounced
"guilty of most deep contumacy," and had been excommunicated. Henry
could not interfere in this stage of the business with any show of
regard to the laws, agreeably to which (blind, and cruel, and
bloodthirsty, and wicked, as we may deem them,) the proceedings
undoubtedly had been conducted; he therefore, as it should seem, could
not do otherwise than direct the schedule, then presented to him by
Lord Cobham, to be referred to the tribunal which the law had
appointed to hear and determine the charges. On this turn of his
affairs, the valiant knight and sincere Christian had recourse to
various pleas and measures, for which were we
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page367" name="page367">(p. 367)</a></span>
to condemn
him, as he has been condemned, we should act most unjustly. We must
not judge him by the standard of our own times, nor with reference to
principles on which we might justly be arraigned ourselves. But let
the same measure of justice be dealt to all alike; and whilst the
eulogist of Lord Cobham pleads in excuse the "wretched state of
society" then
existing,<a id="notetag278" name="notetag278"></a><a href="#note278">[278]</a>
let all the circumstances of time and
society and law be taken into calm consideration before we condemn
Henry, or rather before we withhold from him the praise of moderation,
liberality, and true Christian kindness. The result of this visit to
the King (to which the Archbishop's record does not allude) is thus
stated by Fox. "Then desired Lord Cobham in the King's presence that a
hundred knights and esquires might be suffered to come in upon his
purgation, which he knew would clear him of all heresies. Moreover, he
offered himself after the law of arms to fight for life or death with
any man living, Christian or heathen, in the quarrel of his faith; the
King and the Lords of his council excepted. Finally, with all
gentleness he protested before all that were present, that he would
refuse no manner of correction that should, after the laws of God, be
ministered unto him; but that he would at all times with all meekness
obey it. Notwithstanding all this, the King suffered him to be
summoned personally in his own privy chamber." There is one
circumstance of very great importance, omitted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page368" name="page368">(p. 368)</a></span>
by Milner,
Turner, and others; but which cannot be neglected if we would deal
fairly by Henry. Fox gives a circumstantial statement of it; and it is
of itself sufficient to account for whatever of "strait handling" may
have been shown by the King to his unhappy friend at that hour. Lord
Cobham, though he had repeatedly professed that the King was his
supreme head, and liege Lord, and competent judge, and no other; and
that he owed neither suit nor service to the Pope, whom he denounced
as Antichrist; yet now appealed in the presence of the King
peremptorily to the Pope, not on the heat of the moment, but by a
written document which he showed to the King. The King overruled this
appeal;<a id="notetag279" name="notetag279"></a><a href="#note279">[279]</a>
at least, he informed the accused that he should remain
in custody until it was allowed by the Pope, and that at all events
the Archbishop should be his judge. He was then arrested again at the
King's command, and taken to the Tower of London, "to keep his day,"
the time appointed for his trial. But the reader will judge more
satisfactorily of the proceeding after reading the statement of Fox
himself. "Then said the Lord Cobham to the King that he had appealed
from the Archbishop
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page369" name="page369">(p. 369)</a></span>
to the Pope of Rome, and therefore he
ought, he said, in no cause to be his judge; and, having his appeal
there at hand ready written, he showed it with all reverence to the
King. Wherewith the King was then much more displeased than afore, and
said angerly unto him that he should not pursue his appeal; but rather
he should tarry in hold till such time as it were of the Pope allowed,
and then, would he or nild he, the Archbishop should be his
judge."<a id="notetag280" name="notetag280"></a><a href="#note280">[280]</a></p>

<p>How far at this juncture the King was competent to take upon himself
the responsibility of forbidding any further proceedings against the
individual on whose head the church had resolved to pour the full vial
of its wrath and vengeance; and, if he had by law the power, how far
he could consistently with the safety of his throne and the peace of
his kingdom have done so, are questions not hastily to be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page370" name="page370">(p. 370)</a></span>
determined. Certain it is, that, not two years after Lord Cobham's
first citation, Henry seems to have been thought by the
council<a id="notetag281" name="notetag281"></a><a href="#note281">[281]</a>
to be so far from forward in the work of persecution, as to need from
them a memorial to be more vigilant and energetic in his measures
"against the malice of the Lollards;" and to require the Archbishops
and Bishops to do their duty in that respect. Henry, though sincerely
attached to the religion of Rome, yet, whether at the stake in
Smithfield, or in his own palace at Kennington, appears to have
endeavoured "to do the work of the good Samaritan," and to the very
verge of prudence to interpose between the execution of a cruel law,
and the sufferings of a fellow-creature for conscience sake; not by
setting himself up against the law of the kingdom over which he
reigned, but by gentleness and persuasion, and promises and threats,
to induce his subjects not to defy the law. Our inquiry does not
require or allow us to follow the steps of the devoted Lord Cobham
through his examinations before the ecclesiastical judges, nor to
pronounce upon the conduct and language either of
Arundel<a id="notetag282" name="notetag282"></a><a href="#note282">[282]</a> or his
prisoner. Henry seems to have taken no part in the proceedings
whatever.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page371" name="page371">(p. 371)</a></span>
But after the definitive sentence had been passed,
and he had been left to the secular power,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page372" name="page372">(p. 372)</a></span>
and remanded in
custody of Sir Robert Morley to the Tower, we must observe that though
according to Fox himself, the Archbishop had compelled the lay power
by most terrible menacings of cursings and interdictions to assist him
against that seditious apostate, schismatic, and heretic, and troubler
of the public peace, that enemy of the realm and great adversary of
holy church, (for all these hateful names did he give him,") yet the
King's writ for his execution was not forthcoming, and, as far as we
have any means of knowing, never was it issued. In the case of Sautre,
the sentence of his degradation and delivery to the secular power was
passed, and the King's writ for execution is tested on the very same
day, February 26th,
1401.<a id="notetag283" name="notetag283"></a><a href="#note283">[283]</a>
In the case of Badby, the sentence, the
King's writ, and the execution of the persecuted victim, followed in
one and the same day hard upon each
other.<a id="notetag284" name="notetag284"></a><a href="#note284">[284]</a>
But though Lord Cobham
was sentenced on Monday, September 25, 1413, yet he remained in the
Tower some time,&mdash;Fox says, "a certain space;" Milner says, "some
weeks,"&mdash;and no warrant of execution was forthcoming. Indeed, as far
as the record speaks, no such writ was ever issued by the King. The
Tower was no ordinary prison,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page373" name="page373">(p. 373)</a></span>
and yet Lord Cobham
escaped<a id="notetag285" name="notetag285"></a><a href="#note285">[285]</a>
by night, no one knew how. Whether by connivance or not,
and, if by connivance, whether from any intimation of the King's
wishes or not, was never
stated.<a id="notetag286" name="notetag286"></a><a href="#note286">[286]</a>
Many conjectures and surmises
were afloat, but no satisfactory account of his escape was ever made
known to the public. Certain it is that, had the King been a "cruel
persecutor," had he been as ready to meet the desires of the hierarchy
as his father was in the case of Sautre or Badby, a few hours only
after the ecclesiastical sentence was passed would have borne Lord
Cobham from the power of his persecutors to the place where the wicked
cease from troubling, and where the weary are at rest. Walsingham says
that both Henry and the Archbishop were desirous of saving Oldcastle's
life, and that the Archbishop requested the King to give him a respite
of forty
days.<a id="notetag287" name="notetag287"></a><a href="#note287">[287]</a>
But, adds Walsingham, he escaped, and spent the
time in preparing soldiers for revenge.</p>

<p>Had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page374" name="page374">(p. 374)</a></span>
Henry been merely indifferent on this point, the writ
would have issued as a matter of course. We have seen that, before any
proceedings were instituted against him, Henry used his utmost
endeavours and personal exertions to prevent the gallant knight from
falling into the dangers which threatened; and now, when nothing but
his own writ to the sheriff was wanted to bring the last scene of the
sad tragedy to a close, the King withheld it. The Archbishop, we are
told by Fox, compelled the lay power, by most terrible menacings of
cursing and interdictions, to assist him against Lord Cobham; and we
may be satisfied, the clergy, after denouncing him in convocation, and
after such vast pains had been undergone to subject him to the penalty
of death, would not have failed to press their sovereign to
extremities against this ringleader of their enemies: and yet the writ
of execution is withheld, and the condemned prisoner escapes. Whatever
inference may be drawn from these proceedings, at all events they give
no colour to the charge of persecution; on the contrary, the conduct
of Henry of Monmouth shews throughout indications
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page375" name="page375">(p. 375)</a></span>
of a
kind-hearted good man, averse from violence, anxious to avoid
extremities, withholding his hand from shedding of blood; and that not
from a carelessness or ignorance in the matter, for he was sincerely
attached to the Roman communion, believing it to be the true religion
of Christ, and had also made proficiency in the learning of the time.
Compared with the knowledge of those who have lived in more favoured
times, and whilst the true light has shone from the sanctuary of the
Gospel on the inhabitants of our land, Henry's acquaintance with
divine things may appear scanty. But he certainly had possessed
himself of a large share of Christian verity, and he was earnestly
bent on maintaining the faith which he had espoused. The system,
however, of the law of terror found no willing supporter in him. His
forbearance from persecution sprang from a genuine feeling of
humanity, the spirit of philanthropy and kindness.</p>

reflections.</span></h3>


<p>From the escape of Lord Cobham, or perhaps from the extraordinary
affair of St. Giles' Field, which must now engage our attention, we
perceive a most evident change in the sentiments and conduct of King
Henry towards the Lollards, and especially towards Lord Cobham. Up to
that time he seems to have considered their only crime to have been
heresy, and he anxiously employed his good offices to rescue and save
them: after that time he appears to have regarded them as his own
personal enemies, subverters of order, traitors to the throne and the
kingdom; and their heresy and schism
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page377" name="page377">(p. 377)</a></span>
were identified in his
mind with the crimes of sedition and
treason.<a id="notetag288" name="notetag288"></a><a href="#note288">[288]</a>
How far this view
of their principles and designs was just, has been disputed. Both
sides of the question have been strongly maintained. The inquiry is by
no means devoid of interest in itself; and, as far as Henry's conduct
and character are involved in the transactions of that time, is
indispensable; and throughout the inquiry it must be remembered that
the elucidation of his character, not the acquittal or conviction
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page378" name="page378">(p. 378)</a></span>
of Oldcastle and the Lollards, is the object we have in view.</p>

<p>Hume, depending implicitly on the old chroniclers, pronounces Cobham
as the ringleader, and his followers guilty of treason. Fox, in his
Book of Martyrs, has supplied Milner and many others with a very
different view. Even Le Bas, in his "Life of Wiclif," though he is
compelled to acknowledge that, "with every allowance for the
exaggerations of malice, of bigotry, and of terror, it is scarcely
possible to believe that imputations so dark could have been <i>wholly</i>
fictitious and unfounded," yet is unfortunately contented with the
statements and arguments of later compilers, instead of satisfying
himself from the original documents. He could scarcely have read the
terms which Henry V. used in the different documents of his pardon to
the offenders, or even in his proclamation of a reward for the capture
of Sir John Oldcastle, when he tells us, "it should never be forgotten
that the records of their persecution are wholly silent on the subject
of sedition or conspiracy."</p>

<p>It is curious to read the opposite accounts given of the affair of St.
Giles' Field by two modern historians, both having access to precisely
the same documents. Hume thus summarily disposes of the
case:&mdash;"Cobham, who was confined in the Tower, made his escape before
the day appointed for his
execution.<a id="notetag289" name="notetag289"></a><a href="#note289">[289]</a>
The bold spirit of the man,
provoked by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page379" name="page379">(p. 379)</a></span>
persecution and stimulated by zeal, was urged to
attempt the most criminal enterprises; and his unlimited authority
over the new sect proved that he well merited the attention of the
civil magistrate. He formed, in his retreat, very violent designs
against his enemies; and, despatching his emissaries to all quarters,
appointed a general rendezvous of the party in order to seize the
person of the King at Eltham, and put their persecutors to the sword.
Henry, apprised of their intention, removed to Westminster: Cobham was
not discouraged by this disappointment, but changed the place of
rendezvous to the field near St. Giles's. The King, having shut the
gates of the city to prevent any reinforcement to the Lollards from
that quarter, came into the field in the night-time, seized such of
the conspirators as appeared, and afterwards laid hold of the several
parties who were hastening to the place appointed. It appeared that a
few only were in the secret of the conspiracy; the rest implicitly
followed their leaders: but, upon the trial of the prisoners, the
treasonable designs of the sect were rendered certain, both from
evidence and from the confession of the criminals themselves. Some
were executed, the greater number pardoned. Cobham himself, who made
his escape by flight, was not brought to justice till four years
after; when he was hanged as a traitor, and his body was burnt on the
gibbet, in execution of the sentence pronounced against
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page380" name="page380">(p. 380)</a></span>
him
as a heretic. This criminal design, which was perhaps aggravated by
the clergy, brought discredit upon the party, and checked the progress
of that sect, which had embraced the speculative doctrines of
Wickliffe, and at the same time aspired to a reformation of
ecclesiastical abuses."</p>

<p>Of the same affair Milner's version is this:&mdash;"The royal proclamation
did not put an end to the assemblies of the Lollards. Like the
primitive Christians, they met in smaller companies and more
privately, and often in the dead of the night. St. Giles' Fields, then
a thicket, was a place of frequent resort on these occasions; and here
a number of them assembled on the evening of January the 6th,
1414,<a id="notetag290" name="notetag290"></a><a href="#note290">[290]</a>
with the intention, as was usual, of continuing together to
a very late hour. The King was then at Eltham, a few miles from
London. He received intelligence that Lord Cobham, at the head of
twenty thousand of his party, was stationed in St. Giles' Fields for
the purpose of seizing the person of the King, putting their
persecutors to the sword, and making himself the regent of the realm.
Henry suddenly armed the few soldiers he could muster, put himself at
their head, and marched to the place. He attacked the Lollards, and
soon put them into confusion.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page381" name="page381">(p. 381)</a></span>
About twenty were killed, and
sixty taken: among these was one Beverley, their preacher; who, with
two others, Sir Roger Acton and John Brown, was afterwards put to
death. The King marched on, but found no more bodies of men. He
thought he had surprised only the advanced guard, whereas he had
routed the whole army. This extraordinary affair is represented by the
popish writers as a real conspiracy; and it has given them occasion to
talk loudly against the tenets of the reformers, which could encourage
such crimes. Mr. Hume also has enlisted himself on the same side of
the question, and in the most peremptory and decisive manner
pronounced Lord Cobham guilty of high treason."</p>

<p>Milner<a id="notetag291" name="notetag291"></a><a href="#note291">[291]</a>
depends upon "the able and satisfactory vindication of
Lord Cobham by Fox, the martyrologist," whom he affirms to have
examined with great diligence and judgment <i>all</i> the authentic
documents. It is very dangerous to place implicit reliance on any one,
however impartial he may be; especially ought we to seek evidence for
ourselves, when an author professes, as Fox does, his object to be the
vindication of one party and the conviction of another. On this point
there are two or three unquestionably original documents, neither of
which does Fox
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page382" name="page382">(p. 382)</a></span>
examine, and on which probably the large
majority of readers will be disposed to rest, as the safest ground for
their opinion on Henry's conduct. In the course of the very day, on
the early morning of which, and during the night preceding, the affair
in St. Giles' Field took place, the King offers a reward of five
hundred marks to any by whose counsel Lord Cobham should be taken, one
thousand marks to any who should take him, and immunities and
privileges to any city or town whose burgesses should bring him before
the King. This proclamation, dated Westminster, 11th of January 1414,
assigns these reasons for the offer of such rewards for his capture:
"Since, by his abetting, very many of our subjects called Lollards
have maintained diverse opinions against the Catholic faith; and
contrary to their duty of allegiance, and falsely and traitorously,
have imagined our death, because we have taken part against them and
their opinions as a true Christian prince, and as we are bound by the
obligation of an oath; and because they have plotted very many
designs, as well for the destruction of the Catholic faith, as of the
state of the lords and great men of our realm, as well spiritual as
temporal; and, to fulfil their wicked purpose, have designed to make
diverse unlawful assemblies, to the probable destruction of our own
person, and of the states of the lords and nobles aforesaid."</p>

<p>In the same proclamation we find these words, which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page383" name="page383">(p. 383)</a></span> most
persons will probably interpret as a proof of Henry's desire to mingle
mercy with justice: "We, observing how some of these Lollards and
others, who have designed our death and other crimes and evils, have
been taken on the past occasion, and are condemned to death; and
wishing hereafter, in a better and more gentle manner, as far as we
can, to avoid the shedding of the blood of Christians, especially of
our subjects, whom, for the tender and especial regard we have towards
them, we desire with all anxiety of mind to preserve from
blood-shedding and personal punishment," &amp;c.</p>

<p>Another offer of pardon was made in a proclamation dated March 28,
1414. It seems that many vexatious prosecutions had taken place, and
great disquietude and alarm had in consequence prevailed, and there
was danger lest the good and sound members of the community might be
condemned with the wicked and reckless disturbers of the public peace.
The King therefore offers a free
pardon<a id="notetag292" name="notetag292"></a><a href="#note292">[292]</a>
to all who will apply for
letters of pardon before the Feast of St. John the Baptist: there are,
however, ten or twelve exceptions; among others, Sir John Oldcastle,
Thomas Talbot, Thomas Drayton, rector of Drayton Beauchamp. In the
body of this act of grace we read this pious sentiment of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page384" name="page384">(p. 384)</a></span>
Henry: "We, from reverence to HIM who hath suddenly granted to us
protection and victory against many of our said enemies, and in his
own holy and good time desires to give pardon and peace to all who
offend against himself, lest he destroy them in their iniquities and
sins,&mdash;we, for the tranquillity, security, and peace of our lieges and
subjects, decree this pardon."</p>

<p>In the December of the same year was the following pardon proclaimed,
which, among other things, fixes the precise date of the affair in St.
Giles' Field, and supplies, what has been triumphantly demanded by
those who will pronounce the whole to have been a mere invention, <i>the
conviction of an accused party</i>. "Whereas John Longacre of Wykeham,
formerly of London, mercer, was indicted before William Roos of
Hamelak, and others our justices, assigned to try treasons, felonies,
&amp;c. in our county of Middlesex, for plotting to put us and our
brothers to death, and to make Sir John Oldcastle regent of this
kingdom; and had resolved, with twenty thousand men, to execute their
wicked purpose; and on the Wednesday after the Epiphany, in the first
year of our reign, there Sir John Oldcastle and others, traitorously
persevering in such purpose, traitorously met together in St. Giles'
Great Field, and compassed our death; and the said Longacre pleaded
'not guilty,' and put himself on his country; and he was by the
inquiry [inquest] found guilty,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page385" name="page385">(p. 385)</a></span>
and condemned to be drawn
from the Tower of London to St. Giles' Field, and there to be hanged;
we, of our special grace, have pardoned the said John Longacre."</p>

<p>It is impossible for any candid mind to read these documents without
being convinced that Henry was fully and reasonably assured of the
treasonable practices of Oldcastle and his adherents, and that he was
anxious to deal as mercifully with his enemies as would be consistent
with a due regard to the peace and safety of the realm; and his
biographer considers this as all which legitimately falls within his
province. Whether Oldcastle himself were on that night in St. Giles'
Field, is now a question probably beyond the reach of certain
conclusion. The King's pardon to Longacre declares that he was
present, and there is no evidence on record against it. These are the
documents on which we must form our opinion. They are not traditionary
stories, written many years after the event; they are not manifestos
published in a foreign land; they are State-documents published on the
very spot, all in the same year, one on the very day after the
transaction, one in the March, and the last in the December following.
With reference to Fox's arguments,&mdash;whilst every one would, on many
accounts, do well to read them,&mdash;it will be immediately obvious, that
"though twenty thousand were said to be expected, and a few hundreds
only were found," yet that the large body of adherents who were to
rendezvous in St. Giles'
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page386" name="page386">(p. 386)</a></span>
Field were to come from the city,
and that on the first news of the meeting of the Lollards Henry sent
to order the city gates to be
shut.<a id="notetag293" name="notetag293"></a><a href="#note293">[293]</a>
Fox also says that any
conspiracy is incredible in which only three names could be fixed
upon; but this only argues in him an ignorance of the documents above
referred to, in which many persons are by name excepted from the
pardon, and reference is made to many others accused in different
parts of the country. It can no longer be doubted that Lord Cobham was
believed by Henry to have entered into a treasonable conspiracy
against the government and the person of the King; though, after he
escaped from the Tower, there is no evidence yet
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page387" name="page387">(p. 387)</a></span>
discovered
(except the King's own declaration) to prove that he was in Fickett's
Field, as the place of meeting near St. Giles' church was called.</p>

<p>Of the seditious and treasonable conduct of Oldcastle, no one seems to
have entertained any doubt before the time of Fox, who wrote more than
a century and a half after the event. The Chronicle of London, written
about 1442, not thirty years after the transaction, after stating the
capture and execution of "diverse men," "much folk," among the rest "a
squire of Sir John Oldcastle," adds these words: "And certainly the
said Sir John, with great multitude of Lollards and heretics, were
purposed with full will and might to have destroyed the King and his
brethren, which be protectors
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page388" name="page388">(p. 388)</a></span>
of holy church, and them also
that be in degree of holy order in the service of God and his church;
the which will and purpose, as God would, was let, and Sir John fled
and escaped."<a id="notetag294" name="notetag294"></a><a href="#note294">[294]</a>
Fox quotes the Monk of St. Alban's, whose testimony
in the book entitled "Chronicles of England, and the Fruit of Time,"
speaks in this strong language: "And in the same year (1 Henry V.)
were certain of Lolleis taken, and false heretics, that had purpose of
false treason for to have slain our King, and for to have destroyed
all the clergy of the realm, and they might have had their false
purpose. But our Lord God would not suffer it, for in haste our King
had warning thereof, and of all their false ordinance and working; and
came suddenly with his power to St. John without Smithfield: and anon
they took a captain of the Lolleis and false heretics, and brought
them unto the King's presence, and they told all their false purpose
and ordinance; and then the King commanded them to the Tower, and then
took more of them both within the city and without, and sent them to
Newgate and both Counters; and then they were brought for examination
before the clergy and the King's justices, and there they were
convicted before the clergy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page389" name="page389">(p. 389)</a></span>
for their false heresy, and
condemned before the justices for their false treason."</p>

<p>Walsingham says, referring to the time of Henry's first expedition,
that the Lollards, probably hearing of the treason of Grey, Scroop,
and Cambridge, at Southampton, came out of their lurking-places, and
spoke and wrote on the church-doors treason. And Oldcastle, who was in
concealment near Malvern, having heard, though by a mistake, that the
King had sailed, sent threats to Lord Burgoyne, who forthwith
collected at his castle of Haneley, near Worcester, five thousand men.
Cobham returned to his concealment; but a chaplain of his, and other
partisans, being taken, were so closely questioned that they
discovered the place in which he kept his arms concealed between two
walls.</p>

<p>The author published under the name of Otterbourne, refers to a
document which, if authentic, would establish Oldcastle's treasonable
practices beyond further question. "The Lollards," he says, "meanwhile
were sadly grieved by the discovery of certain schedules and
indentures between John Oldcastle and the Duke of Albany, in which the
Scots are invited to besiege Roxburgh and Berwise [Berwick]. And on
this the Duke laid siege to Berwise by sea and land." Whether all
these testimonies and original documents establish Lord Cobham's guilt
or not, it is impossible to read them without inferring that, at all
events, there was abundant reason
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page390" name="page390">(p. 390)</a></span>
for Henry's own conduct
with regard to
him.<a id="notetag295" name="notetag295"></a><a href="#note295">[295]</a></p>

<p>After his escape to Wales, however, and the exception of his name from
the bill of pardon, and the offer of a reward for his capture, Henry
does not appear to have had anything whatever to do with Lord Cobham
in life or in death. There is something strange and affecting in the
circumstances of his capture and execution. It was towards the close
of the year 1417, whilst parliament was sitting, that news arrived of
the Lord Cobham having been discovered and taken in Wales. After
voting a subsidy to Henry, who was then pursuing his victories with
all his energy in France, "as soon as they heard that the public enemy
was taken, they all agreed not to dissolve parliament until he were
examined and heard." The Lord Powis was sent to bring him to London,
his men having taken him after a desperate
struggle.<a id="notetag296" name="notetag296"></a><a href="#note296">[296]</a>
"He stood,"
says the Monk of Croyland,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page391" name="page391">(p. 391)</a></span>
"at great defence long time, and
was sore wounded or he would be taken. And so the Lord Powis' men
brought him out of Wales to London in a whirlicole." He was forthwith
carried before the parliament as an outlaw, on the charge of treason,
and, as an excommunicated heretic, given over to the secular power. He
heard the several convictions, and made no answer to the charges; and
was then instantly condemned to be taken to the Tower, and thence to
the new gallows in St. Giles' Field, and there to be hanged for his
treason, and to be burnt hanging for his heresy. There was,
undoubtedly, great irregularity and hurry in this proceeding. But
probably the statement of the Monk of St. Alban's is not far from the
truth. "So he was brought to Westminster, and there was examined on
certain points, and he said not nay; and so he was convicted of the
clergy for his heresy, and dampned before the justices to the death
for treason: and he was led to the Tower again, and there he was laid
on a hurdle, and drawn through
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page392" name="page392">(p. 392)</a></span>
the city to St. Giles' Field.
And there was made a new pair of gallows, and a strong chain, and a
collar of iron for him; and there he was hanged, and burnt on the
gallows, and all for his lewdness and false opinions."</p>

<p>And here we must close this sad tragedy, in the last scene of which
King Henry took no part. He was spared the pain of either sanctioning
or witnessing these transactions. The first information he received of
his unhappy friend's capture, probably certified him also of his
death; and whatever we may suppose to have been his sentiments on the
removal from this world of one whom he certainly believed guilty of
treason, and the enemy of his throne; his kindness of heart, and
sympathy with the brave and the good, must have made him, even in the
midst of the din of war and the flush of victory, lament the fate of
one whom for so many years he had held in affection and esteem. Henry
probably felt a melancholy satisfaction that he was spared the sad
duty, for so he must have deemed it, of sanctioning the last sentence
on his friend. They are now both in the hands of Him to whom all
hearts are open, and from whom no secret is hid; and there we leave
them to his just but merciful disposal.</p>

<p>Henry of Monmouth's name seems never to have been associated by our
historians with the death of any one condemned to the flames as a
heretic, except in the case of those two persons the circumstances of
whose last hours have been examined at length in this inquiry,&mdash;Badby,
whom he endeavoured to save even at the stake, and Oldcastle, whose
execution he respited, and for whose death he never issued the
warrant. There are, however, three prosecutions for heresy, which,
though hitherto unconnected with the question discussed in these
chapters, seem to claim a patient consideration before this inquiry is
closed, and the final answer be returned to the question, Was Henry a
persecutor for religious opinions? The names of the three persecuted
for maintaining opinions
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page394" name="page394">(p. 394)</a></span>
different from the dogmas of the
church of Rome, to whose convictions and deaths our attention is here
drawn, are John Clayton, or Claydon, George
Gurmyn,<a id="notetag297" name="notetag297"></a><a href="#note297">[297]</a>
and William
Taylor.</p>

<p>The case of John Clayton, whether we look to it merely as a
well-authenticated fact of history, or seek from it ancillary evidence
as to the principles and conduct of Henry in the matter of religious
persecution, involves subjects of deep interest. The satisfaction with
which it is believed many may view it, as one of the incidents which
seem to imply that Henry was an unwilling, reluctant executor of the
penal laws of his kingdom, and took the lead of his people in
liberality and toleration, must be mingled with pain sincerely felt on
witnessing the stewards of the word of life becoming the zealous and
relentless exactors of a cruel and iniquitous law, straining to the
very utmost its enactments to cover their deeds of blood, and
sacrificing their fellow-creatures to the image they had set up. The
case of Clayton puts
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page395" name="page395">(p. 395)</a></span>
the excessive enormities of the
hierarchy of that day in a more striking point of view than many
others of the more generally cited instances of persecution. Clayton's
was not the case of a powerful man like Cobham, whose very character
and station, and rank and influence, made him formidable: Clayton's
was not the case of a learned man, or an eloquent preacher, or an
active, zealous propagator of those new doctrines from which the see
of Rome anticipated so much evil to her cause. His was the case of a
tradesman, unable to read himself, and engaging another to read to him
out of a book which seemed to give him pleasure; the place of reading
being a private room in a private house, the time of reading being the
Lord's day, and other festivals of the church; and the witnesses
against him being his own servant and his own apprentice. Had the
record of this sad persecution been written by an enemy to the
priesthood, we should have suspected that the whole case was
misrepresented, that a colouring had been unfairly given to the
proceedings, to make them more odious in our sight; and though, at the
best, such proceedings must be detestable, we should have deemed that
in this case the facts had been distorted to meet the prejudiced views
of the writer. But the proceedings are registered in the authentic
records of the Archbishop of
Canterbury,<a id="notetag298" name="notetag298"></a><a href="#note298">[298]</a>
and are minutely
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page396" name="page396">(p. 396)</a></span>
detailed in all the circumstances of time, and place, and person.</p>

<p>John Clayton was a currier, or skinner, living in the parish of St.
Anne's, "Aldrychgate." In those days few tradesmen could read, and he
was not an exception. But he had at an early period formed a very
favourable opinion of the new doctrines; the preaching of Wickliffe's
followers, or, it may be, of Wickliffe himself, had made so deep an
impression on his mind, that nothing could shake the firmness and
constancy of his belief to the day of his death. His predilection for
"Lollardy," as the profession of the new doctrines was called, became
known to the ecclesiastical rulers long before the statute for burning
heretics was passed in England; and his religious opinions exposed him
to great troubles and hardships, even in the reign of Richard II. He
was arrested on suspicion of heresy, and carried before Braybrook,
Bishop of London. The consequence of his conviction was imprisonment,
first in Conway Castle for two years, and subsequently in the Fleet
for the term of three years more. He then renounced the errors alleged
against him, and abjured them at the time when "Lord John Searle" was
chancellor of England, about the year 1400. Through the reign of Henry
IV, and the two first years of Henry V, Clayton seems to have remained
unmolested. No sooner, however, had Henry left England on his first
expedition to France, than Clayton was seized, tried, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page397" name="page397">(p. 397)</a></span>
condemned. There seems to have been unusual despatch evinced in every
stage of the proceedings. Clayton was not cited by regular process.
The Mayor of London arrested him, and brought him before the
Archbishop's consistory, on Saturday, August 17th, when he was
examined, and remanded till the next Monday, August 19th. On which day
he was brought up again, and finally condemned as a wilful relapsed
heretic.</p>

<p>At that very time, Henry, having dismissed his ships, was first
commencing the siege of Harfleur; he had left England only the
preceding Sunday. Whether the time selected for Clayton's arrest and
trial was merely accidental, or whether the civil and ecclesiastical
authorities (for both were equally eager for the blood of their
victim) seized upon the opportunity of Henry's first absence from
England, is a question which ought not to be decided before all the
circumstances attending both Clayton's execution and the proceedings
against Taylor (which will be next examined) shall have been carefully
weighed. One of the witnesses, who testified to overt acts of heresy
(such as those on which he was condemned) having been seen in
Clayton's conduct a year before the time of trial, was living in the
house of the Mayor of London; and that functionary seems to have
hurried on the prosecution with more zeal than considerateness, and to
have kept the young man in readiness to give his testimony whenever a
favourable opportunity offered.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page398" name="page398">(p. 398)</a></span>
Such circumstances cannot be
contemplated without suspicion. At all events, the plain fact is,
that, on the very Saturday after Henry sailed from England, Clayton
was brought under arrest, not under process of citation, before the
ecclesiastical judges by the Mayor of London, who was ready with his
witnesses.</p>

<p>The charges brought against Clayton were, that, having renounced
heresy, he had again been guilty of the same crime, by associating
with persons suspected of heresy, and by having heretical books in his
possession. To establish these facts, in addition to his own
confession that he "had been imprisoned in the time of Bishop
Braybrooke on a charge of heresy, and had subsequently renounced in
the time of Chancellor Searle, and had heard read about one quarter of
the book then produced," they proceeded to examine two witnesses who
had been inmates in Clayton's family.</p>

<p>The first witness swore that he had been, some time past, a servant
and apprentice of John Clayton; that he had seen one John Fuller, a
fellow-servant of his, reading the book, which he then identified, to
his master, in St. Martin's Lane, on certain festival days since
Easter; that in the book were the ten commandments in English, but
what else it contained he knew not; that John Clayton seemed to be
delighted with the book, and to regard it as sound and Catholic.</p>

<p>Another witness, Saunder Philip, a lad fifteen years
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page399" name="page399">(p. 399)</a></span>
old, a
servant of Clayton's, but living at the time of the trial in the house
of the Mayor of London, testified that he saw the book brought into
Clayton's house about the middle of the preceding Lent; that he heard
Clayton, his master, say that he would rather pay three times the
price of the book than be without it; and that, on several occasions,
through the year before, he saw and heard persons suspected of heresy
conversing with Clayton.</p>

<p>To what miserable, degrading expedients were these persecutors obliged
to condescend in compassing their designs! compelling those who ate of
the bread of the accused, and drank of his cup, and were his own
domestic servants, and confidential inmates of his home, to bear the
testimony of death against him: verifying among Christians what the
Lord of Christians prophesied as the result of pagan opposition to the
Gospel itself, "A man's foes shall be those of his own household."</p>

<p>The poor man himself confessed that he believed he had heard about
one-fourth part of the book read. The book produced, and identified by
the witnesses, was called "The Lantern of Light;" in which the
ecclesiastical judges pronounced many gross and wicked heresies to be
contained. Among other articles objected to, some of which were
doubtless in a more palpable manner adverse to the favourite doctrines
of Romanism, we find the following criterion of the lawfulness and
virtue of alms-giving.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page400" name="page400">(p. 400)</a></span>
The author maintained that alms were
neither lawful nor virtuous, unless four conditions were observed in
the distribution of them.</p>

<p>1.&mdash;Unless they be given to the honour of God.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;Unless they be given from goods justly gotten.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;Unless they be given to one whom the donor believed to be in a
state of Christian charity.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;Unless they be given to such as in very deed, without dissembling
or pretence, are in need.</p>

<p>That the parts of the book which contained the heretical doctrines
were ever read to Clayton, does not seem to have been elicited at the
examination. The witnesses could only depose to having heard the
Decalogue read in English, but nothing more; and the poor man's own
confession acknowledged only that he had heard about one quarter of
the work read. Still, on this confession and this evidence, and for
this offence, John Clayton was convicted of heresy, was condemned as a
relapsed heretic, and left without mercy to the secular power. Fox,
who quotes no authority, adds only, that he "was by the temporal
magistrates not long after had to Smithfield and burnt."</p>

<p>The ecclesiastical record contains no information after the sentence
passed on Monday the 19th of August, and our historians seem not to
have made any inquiries as to the fate of this man. Recent researches,
however, into original documents have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page401" name="page401">(p. 401)</a></span>
been made by the
Author, with the view of facilitating the present inquiry, and
rendering it more satisfactory; and the successful result of those
researches enables him to throw some additional light on the subject
under investigation. The following facts deserve especial attention.
Shortly after the above sentence was passed by the ecclesiastical
authorities, the Mayor and citizens of London wrote a letter to King
Henry, rehearsing the judgment of the ecclesiastical court on John
Clayton, and expressing their intention to make an example of the
convict by carrying the sentence into execution. But they desired the
King to send them his especial directions on the subject, as they were
desirous to avoid giving offence in this as well as in all other
affairs. The answer of Henry to this request, if it was ever made, is
certainly not recorded. The strong probability is that the execution
took place before there had been time for the King's answer, if he
ever sent one, to reach London. The sheriffs of London state in this
same year that "they had expended 20<i>s.</i> about the burning of John
Claydon, skinner, and George Gurmyn, baker, Lollards convicted of
heresy," though the day of the execution is not recorded.</p>

<p>It must here be remembered, that the Mayor himself arrested Clayton,
and produced the witnesses against him; that the King's
writ<a id="notetag299" name="notetag299"></a><a href="#note299">[299]</a> was
not necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page402" name="page402">(p. 402)</a></span>
to authorize execution after judgment passed by
the ecclesiastical authority in convocation; and that, even if it had
been necessary to procure the royal sanction, the Duke of Clarence was
left in England with full powers, as Henry's representative. Yet, in
order to avoid giving offence, though they were determined to make an
example of Clayton, they were afraid to proceed to the extreme penalty
of the law without first taking the instructions of the King. This
would scarcely
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page403" name="page403">(p. 403)</a></span>
have been necessary, nor would any hesitation,
or scruple, or misgiving have arisen in their minds, had they not been
under a strong practical persuasion that the execution of this man
would have given their King displeasure. And when we know what
employment awaited Henry from the very day of Clayton's conviction
till his return home,&mdash;the siege of Harfleur, the harassing march
through France, the battle of Agincourt,&mdash;we cannot wonder at no
answer being recorded. Perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page404" name="page404">(p. 404)</a></span>
he made no answer; perhaps the
letter never reached him in the midst of his struggles and dangers;
probably he did not interfere, but allowed the law to take its course.
Whatever took place between the condemnation and the death of Clayton,
every stage of the transaction, from the first arrest of the accused
on the very Saturday after Henry sailed for France, makes it quite
clear that, in the opinion of the magistrates of London, Henry would
be no willing abettor of persecution.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>A case, however, of no ordinary character as a matter of historical
record, and doubly important to those who take an interest in the
result of the present investigation, requires to be examined in all
its bearings (especially with reference to the dates of its several
stages) with greater care than has hitherto been bestowed upon it.</p>

<p>In the July of 1416, whilst the Emperor Sigismund and Henry were both
in England, Archbishop Chicheley gave evidence of his zeal by issuing
most stringent mandates, directing his suffragan bishops to make
diligent search for heretics, to report the names and circumstances of
all who were suspected of heresy under seal to the metropolitan, and
to institute process against them according to law. On the publication
of these injunctions, a most strict and searching inquisition took
place through the country. Still no one suffered the extreme penalty
of the law as a heretic convict.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page405" name="page405">(p. 405)</a></span>
In the next year, no sooner
was Pope Martin V. elected at Constance, than, complaining bitterly of
the neglect and apathy of the ecclesiastical and civil authorities,
the new Pontiff addressed every argument, both of encouragement and of
intimidation, to the laity and the clergy alike, urging them to unite
as one man in the work of extirpating heresy. He even applied to the
English church, that, in their overflowing zeal for the Apostolic See,
they would raise a subsidy in aid of the war then being carried on
against the heretics in Bohemia. Among those who had fallen under
suspicion of heresy, and who were watched with jealous vigilance by
the ecclesiastical authorities, was one William Taylor, who had
proceeded to his degree of Master of Arts in one of the Universities,
and had been admitted into the order of priest in the church. Taylor
was cited to appear before the consistory; and on Monday, February 12,
1420, he confessed before Archbishop Chicheley that in the time of his
predecessor (Arundel) he had been suspected of heresy; and for not
appearing, or for not answering to the charge brought against him, he
had been excommunicated, and had remained under that sentence for
fourteen
years.<a id="notetag300" name="notetag300"></a><a href="#note300">[300]</a>
Upon his expression of sorrow and repentance, he
was commanded to appear on the following Wednesday at Lambeth, where,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page406" name="page406">(p. 406)</a></span>
in the great chapel, he received the pardon of the church on
certain stipulated conditions. He was bound by solemn promises, and by
an oath on the Gospels (thrice repeated), not to offend again; and he
promised to appear in person or by his proctor at the next
convocation, there to confess his penitence. He was then set at
liberty.</p>

<p>Taylor, however, was not long allowed to remain unmolested. Agreeably
to the call of the sovereign Pontiff at Rome, and the peremptory
injunctions of his metropolitan, agreeably also (as it too evidently
appears by the sequel) to his own views of duty, Philip Morgan, Bishop
of Worcester, denounced the same William Taylor in full convocation,
May 5, 1421, as a person vehemently suspected of heresy. The King was
then in London, but was on the eve of leaving the kingdom; and fully
occupied in preparing to proceed forthwith to wipe off the disgrace
which had fallen on the English arms, and to restore confidence to his
troops, then much depressed by the unexpected discomfiture of their
countrymen, and the death of the Duke of Clarence in battle. On
Saturday, May 24, Taylor was put upon his trial, being produced before
the court as the Bishop of Worcester's prisoner, who had caused him to
be arrested. Of the three opinions savouring of heresy, (errorem et
hæresin sapientes,) he pleaded guilty to having entertained the two
last, but of the first he seems to have had no knowledge; indeed,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page407" name="page407">(p. 407)</a></span>
it is very difficult to say what meaning could have been attached
to it.</p>

<p>He was charged with having maintained at Bristol.</p>

<p>First, That whosoever suspends on his neck any writing, by that act
takes away the honour due to God only, and renders it to the
Devil.<a id="notetag301" name="notetag301"></a><a href="#note301">[301]</a></p>

<p>Secondly, That Christ was not to be prayed to in his character of man,
but only as God.</p>

<p>Thirdly, That the saints of heaven were not to be addressed in prayer.</p>

<p>On the next Monday, May 26th, he was pronounced guilty of heresy, and
condemned to perpetual imprisonment for the term of his life. So
dreadful a punishment (to which, whatever it might be, he had on his
previous release sworn to submit,) suddenly struck him to the very
heart, and caused him to show some signs of a subdued mind. On which
the Archbishop mitigated that sentence by adding to it an alternative,
"Unless he shall be able to give bail, to the satisfaction of the
Chancellor of England."</p>

<p>We have already intimated that Henry's thoughts were at this time
fully and anxiously occupied in preparing for an immediate expedition
to France; and it is to be observed that, on the very day after
Taylor's condemnation, the King issued his writ to the sheriffs,
commanding them to publish his proclamation for all persons to hasten
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page408" name="page408">(p. 408)</a></span>
with the greatest speed to join the King in his voyage.
Taylor left the court in custody, as the prisoner of the Bishop of
Worcester, to end his days in a dungeon, unless he should be able to
produce the required bail; in which case the Bishop was authorized by
the court to release him.</p>

<p>When Henry left London, on the Monday after Taylor's condemnation, he
left it never to return. His death, as we have seen, took place on the
last day of August 1422. That Henry knew anything of the prosecution
of this person, does not appear; and, if he had been made acquainted
with the intended proceedings, whether he expressed any opinion upon
them in favour of maintaining the faith by the secular arm, or in
favour of the gentle and mild means of persuasion,&mdash;is a matter lost
to history, and all inquiry into any of those points must be
fruitless. Nor are we informed whether the poor man could produce the
required bail, or whether he remained a prisoner till his death. Some
expressions in the record of the subsequent transactions would induce
us to infer that he had, after his condemnation, been at large and was
again taken into custody (sub custodiâ carcerali iterum arrestatus).
The striking fact, however, is this,&mdash;that Henry had not been dead six
months before this same priest was brought up a prisoner in the
custody of a jailor, and tried before the same court for a repetition
of the very same
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page409" name="page409">(p. 409)</a></span>
offence; or rather, perhaps, for the very
same individual act for which, a year and three quarters before, he
had been condemned to perpetual imprisonment. The same accuser, the
Bishop of Worcester, charged him with having, <i>since his abjuration
aforesaid</i>, written, maintained, and communicated with a certain
priest, named Thomas Smyth, living at Bristol, on paper in his own
hand-writing, the alleged heretical opinions. Here it must be observed,
that the charge was made by the same accuser, the Bishop of Worcester,
before the same Judge Chicheley; that the place in which he was said
to have held these doctrines was in each case the same, Bristol; that
in each case the doctrines were said to have been conveyed by writing;
and that, as to the time of the offence, the Bishop did not say it was
after his previous condemnation, but only after his recantation, which
took place in February 1420, just a year and a quarter before his
sentence of imprisonment. And if we examine the four heretical
opinions which were extracted, in 1423, by the Canonists out of his
written communication to Thomas Smyth, we shall find them in substance
nothing more or less than two of the opinions on which he was before
condemned to imprisonment in 1421.</p>

<p>1.&mdash;All prayer which is a petition for any supernatural or gratuitous
gift, is to be offered to God alone.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;Prayer
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page410" name="page410">(p. 410)</a></span>
is to be addressed only to
God.<a id="notetag302" name="notetag302"></a><a href="#note302">[302]</a></p>

<p>3.&mdash;To pray to any creature is to commit idolatry.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;The faithful ought to address their prayers to God, not in
reference to his humanity, but only with regard to his Deity.</p>

<p>This was the sum of his offence, involving precisely the identical
opinions of which he had been pronounced guilty in 1421, after his
recantation in
1420.<a id="notetag303" name="notetag303"></a><a href="#note303">[303]</a></p>

<p>After Lynewood had given his opinion that a relapsed heretic was to be
left to the secular court, without hope of pardon, and without being
heard as to the corporal punishment, his judges proceeded to the
extreme execution of the law. Taylor was degraded on Monday the 1st of
March, 1423, in the first year of Henry VI; and, the writ for his
burning being issued on the same day, he suffered death in Smithfield.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>How far these circumstances may be pronounced to bear on the subject,
and to conspire in acquitting Henry of Monmouth of the charge with
which his name has been unsparingly assailed, of having been in spirit
and conduct a persecutor for religious opinions, deserves serious
consideration. When
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page411" name="page411">(p. 411)</a></span>
it is borne in mind that the Lollards
were certainly represented to Henry as the enemies of his throne and
of the peace of the realm; that the Pope and the hierarchy of England
were loud and incessant in their appeals to the authorities to
extirpate such poisonous weeds from the garden of the Lord's heritage;
that the Emperor Sigismund was most zealous in obeying such calls of
the church, and caused his own land to flow with blood; that Henry's
prelates made a direct personal appeal to him to prosecute heretics;
that his council deemed it necessary to remind him of his duty in that
point;<a id="notetag304" name="notetag304"></a><a href="#note304">[304]</a>
that his own chaplain openly charged him with want of zeal
and with apathy in that good cause; that no single warrant for the
execution of any one condemned for heresy alone was ever signed, or,
as far as we can ascertain, was ever sanctioned, by him; that the only
victims of the priesthood actually burnt for heresy alone during his
reign were condemned and executed in Henry's absence from the kingdom;
and that one person sentenced to imprisonment during Henry's life was,
within a few months after his death, condemned to the flames, and
actually burnt for the same offence; when all these points are fairly
weighed, probably
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page412" name="page412">(p. 412)</a></span>
few will not feel satisfied that the
judgment passed upon Henry, on the charge of persecution, is
inconsistent with the soundest principles of historical investigation.</p>

<p class="p2">

<p>The Author, however, is induced to confess that a comparison of the
events of Henry's reign with those which preceded his accession, and
followed his death, has compelled him to form more than a merely
negative opinion on Henry of Monmouth's principles and conduct and
influence. In addition to the circumstances detailed in these
chapters, he would solicit attention to one fact, which no historical
writer seems to have noticed. During the last years of Henry IV. a
greater number of persons appear to have suffered in the fires of
martyrdom than the accounts of our chroniclers would lead us to
suppose.<a id="notetag305" name="notetag305"></a><a href="#note305">[305]</a>
By the cruel operation of the law, the goods and
chattels of convicted heretics were escheated to the crown; and when
Henry came to the throne, several widows and orphans were suffering
severely from the effects of that ruthless enactment. No sooner had he
the power of relieving their distress, than, in the exercise of the
most divine prerogative of the kingly office, he restored to many
their confiscated property. The most correct notion of the motives
which influenced him will be conveyed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page413" name="page413">(p. 413)</a></span>
by the language itself
of the several grants: "We, compassionating the poverty of Isabella,
widow of Richard Turner, who was convicted and put to death for
heresy, of our especial grace have granted to the said Isabella all
the goods and chattels to us forfeited, for the maintenance of herself
and of her
children."<a id="notetag306" name="notetag306"></a><a href="#note306">[306]</a>
Similar grants are recorded, and all in the
first year of his reign, to Alice widow of Walter Yonge, Isabella
widow of John Horewood, and Matilda widow of John Fynche; their
several husbands having suffered for maintaining opinions then
pronounced heretical. This fact seems to be not only confirmatory of
the views we have taken of Henry's tender-heartedness and sympathy
with the afflicted and helpless, but indicative also of the absence of
whatever approaches a persecuting and vindictive spirit towards those
who had incurred the extreme penalty of the law for conscience-sake.
The Author cannot but infer that Henry's dislike of persecution placed
a considerable check on the fierceness with which it raged, both
before and after his reign; that the sanguinary intentions of the
priesthood were, to a very considerable degree, frustrated by his
known love of gentler means; and that in England a greater portion of
religious liberty was enjoyed during the years through which he sat on
the throne, than had been tolerated under the government of his
father, or was afterwards allowed through the minority of his son.</p>

<p>The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page414" name="page414">(p. 414)</a></span>
Author entered upon the subject of the three last
chapters with the view of ascertaining, on the best original evidence,
the validity or the unsoundness of the charge of persecution for
religion brought against Henry of Monmouth. Independently of the
result of that investigation, he confesses himself to have risen from
the inquiry impressed with mingled feelings of apprehension and of
gratitude:&mdash;gratitude for the blessings of the Reformation; and
apprehension lest, in our use of those blessings, and in the return
made to their Almighty Donor, we may be found wanting. For no maxim
can be more firmly established by the sound deductions of human
wisdom, or more unequivocally sanctioned by the express words of
revelation, than the principle that to whom much is given, of them
will much be required. And on this principle how awfully has our
increase of privileges enhanced our responsibility! By the
Reformation, Providence has rescued us from those dangers which once
attended an honest avowal of a Christian's faith; has freed us from
those gross superstitions which once darkened the whole of
Christendom; and has released us from that galling yoke under which
the disciples of the Cross were long held in bondage. The bestowal of
these blessings exacts at our hands many duties of indispensable
obligation. The Author hopes he may be pardoned, if, in closing this
subject, he refers to some of those points
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page415" name="page415">(p. 415)</a></span>
which press upon
his own mind most seriously.</p>

<p>Those who are intrusted with a brighter and a more pure light of
spiritual truth, are, first of all, bound to prove by their lives that
religion is not in them a dead and inoperative letter; but a vivifying
principle, productive of practical holiness and virtue. Enlightened
Christians are bound to show forth their principles by the exercise of
every Christian excellence, and so to prove to the world that God is
with them of a truth.</p>

<p>Another indispensable duty is, that those who possess the truth should
individually and by combined exertions labour to spread its heavenly
influence throughout the whole mass of their fellow-creatures, not
only in every corner of their own land, but to the utmost coasts of
the civilized world, and through the still numberless regions of
barbarism and idolatry. "Freely ye have received, freely give."</p>

<p>Again, it were a narrow view of our duty were we to feel an anxiety
for the preservation, through the period only of our own existence
upon earth, of the benefits which we now enjoy. To be satisfied with
the assurance that provision is made for our own times, is a principle
altogether unworthy a philanthropic and a Christian mind: and the more
valuable and essential the blessing, the more steady and vigorous
should be our labour in providing for its permanency and its future
increase.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page416" name="page416">(p. 416)</a></span>
If we are honest in our own choice, we believe
that by delivering down to posterity, in its integrity and pureness,
the blessing which has been committed to us in especial trust, we are
transmitting not a state-device (as its enemies delight to call it),
but an institution founded on the surest principles of true philosophy
and of revelation, with a view to the best interests of the whole
human race. If, aided by the Divine Founder of the church, we resign
to those who come after us the fostering and mild, but firm and
well-grounded establishment of the Protestant faith, removed equally
from latitudinarian indifference and from the intolerance of bigotry,
with an ungrudging spirit sharing with others the liberty of
conscience we claim for ourselves, we shall transmit an inheritance
which may be to future ages what it has proved itself to be towards
many among ourselves, and of those who have gone before us,&mdash;the
instructor and guide of their youth, the strength and stay of their
manhood, the support and comfort of their declining years;&mdash;an
institution which is the faithful depository of Christian truth; the
surest guardian of civil and religious liberty; the parent of whatever
is just, and generous, and charitable, and holy. <span class="smcap">Esto perpetua</span>!</p>

<h2>APPENDIX, No. II.</h2>


<p>To the miseries which fell upon the inhabitants of Rouen during the
siege, a brief reference has been made in the body of this work. The
following lines, by an eye-witness, record a very pleasing
circumstance indicative of Henry's piety and benevolence. The wretched
inhabitants, who could contribute no aid in the defence of the town,
were driven by the garrison beyond the gates with the most unmerciful
hardheartedness. On Christmas-day Henry offered, in honour of the
festival, to supply all the inhabitants, great and small [meste and
least], with meat and drink. His offer was met very uncourteously by
the garrison, and his benevolent intentions were in a great degree
frustrated. The poem called "The Siege of Rouen" may now be read in
the Archæologia, vol. xxi, with an interesting introduction by the
Reverend William Conybeare.</p>

<p class="left15">SIEGE OF ROUEN.</p>

<p class="poem">
  "But then, within a little space,<br>
  The poor people of that same place<br>
  At every gate they were put out,<br>
  Many a hundred on a rout.<br>
  It was great pity them for to see,<br>
  How women came kneeling on their knee;<br>
  And their children also in their arms,<br>
  For to save them from harms.
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="page423" name="page423">(p. 423)</a></span><br>
  And old men came kneeling them by,<br>
  And there they made a doleful cry;<br>
  And all they cried at once then,<br>
  'Have mercy on us, ye English men!'<br>
  Our men gave them some of their bread,<br>
  Though they to us were now so
        quede.<a id="notetag309" name="notetag309"></a><a href="#note309">[309]</a><br>
  Harm to them we did none,<br>
  But made them again to the ditch gone:<br>
  And there we kept them all abache,<br>
  Because they should not see our watch:<br>
  Many one said they would liefer be slain,<br>
  Than turn to the city of Rouen again.<br>
  They went forth with a strong murmuration,<br>
  And ever they cursed their own nation;<br>
  For the city would not let them in,<br>
  Therefore they did full great sin;<br>
  For many one died there for cold,<br>
  That might full well their life have hold.<br>
  This was at the time of Christmas:<br>
  I may you tell of a full fair case,<br>
  As of great meekness of our good King;<br>
  And also of meekness a great tokening.<br>
  Our King sent into Rouen on Christmas day,<br>
  His heralds in a rich array;<br>
  And said, because of this high feast,<br>
  Both to the meste and to the least<br>
  Within the city, and also without,<br>
  To tell, that be scanty of victuals all about,<br>
  All they to have meat and drink thereto,<br>
  And again safe-conduct to come and to go.<br>
  They said, 'Gramercy!' all lightly,<br>
  As they had set little prize thereby;<br>
  And unnese [scarcely] they would grant any grace<br>
  To the poor people that out put was,<br>
  Save to two priests, and no more them with,<br>
  For to bring meat they granted therewith;
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="page424" name="page424">(p. 424)</a></span><br>
  'But an there come with you and mo [more],<br>
  Truly we will shoot you too.'<br>
  All on a row the poor people were set,<br>
  The priests come and brought them meat;<br>
  They ate and drank, and were full fain,<br>
  And thanked our King with all their main;<br>
  And as they sate, their meat to fong,<br>
  Thus they talked them among:<br>
  'O Mightiful Jesu!' they said then,<br>
  'Of tender heart is the Englishmen;<br>
  For see how this excellent King,<br>
  That we have been ever again standing;<br>
  And never would we obey him to,<br>
  Nor no homage to him would we never do;<br>
  And yet he hath on us more compassion,<br>
  Than hath our own countrymen;<br>

  Grant him grace to win his right in

<h3><span class="smcap">AUTHENTICITY OF THE MANUSCRIPTS</span></h3>

<p class="figcenter">Sloane 1776, and Reg. 13, c. 1.</p>


<p>It will be borne in mind that the only document which contains the
charge brought against Henry of Monmouth of unfilial conduct and cruel
behaviour towards his afflicted father is a manuscript, two copies of
which are preserved in the British Museum; and that a thorough
examination of the authenticity of that manuscript was reserved for
the Appendix. Every right-minded person will agree that the magnitude
and dark character of a charge, so far from justifying a prejudice
against the accused, should induce us to sift with more scrutinizing
jealousy the evidence alleged in support of the accusation.</p>

<p>It will require but a very brief inspection of the two MSS., Sloane
1776, and Reg. 13,
c. 1.,<a id="notetag311" name="notetag311"></a><a href="#note311">[311]</a>
to be assured that they are either both
transcripts from one document in that part of the volume which
contains the history of Henry IV, or that one of these is copied from
the other.<a id="notetag312" name="notetag312"></a><a href="#note312">[312]</a>
Unless, therefore, an intimation be given to the
contrary, it will be understood that reference is made to the Sloane
MS., <span class="pagenum"><a id="page426" name="page426">(p. 426)</a></span>
which, though not copied with equal correctness in point
of orthography and grammar, is still far superior to the King's in the
clearness of the writing.</p>

<p>The Sloane MS.
1776,<a id="notetag313" name="notetag313"></a><a href="#note313">[313]</a>
appears to consist of four portions, though
the same hand copied the whole.</p>

<p>The first portion extends from the commencement to page 40.</p>

<p>The second from page 40 to the end of the account of Henry IV. at page
49.</p>

<p>The third from the commencement of the reign of Henry V. page 50, to
his second expedition to France, mentioned in page 72.</p>

<p>The fourth from that point to the end, at page 94, b.</p>

<p>1. The first portion embraces that part of the reigns of Richard II.
and Henry IV. which falls within the range of the chronicle of the
Monk of Evesham; ending with an account of the marriage of Edmund
Mortimer with a daughter of Owyn Glyndowr, and two cases of sacrilege.</p>

<p>2. The second carries on the history of Henry IV. to the beginning of
his thirteenth year, and contains the passage which charges Henry V.
with the unfilial attempt to supplant his father on the throne. These
first two parts
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page427" name="page427">(p. 427)</a></span>
must be examined together, and in detail;
the last two will require only a few remarks, and may then be
dismissed.</p>

<p>That the history which commences at p. 50 of the Sloane MS. was the
work of an ecclesiastic who attended Henry V. in his first expedition
to France, is made evident at a much earlier point of the narrative
than the translation of it by Sir Harris Nicolas, in the Appendix to
his "Battle of Agincourt," would enable us to infer. The passage
"After having passed the Isle of Wight, swans were seen," should have
been rendered, "After <i>we</i> left the shores of the Isle of Wight
behind, swans appeared." The writer was at the battle of Agincourt,
stationed with the baggage, and with his clerical associates praying
for God's mercy to spare themselves and their countrymen.</p>

<p>That he was not the same person who wrote the history of Richard II.
and Henry IV, now found in the same fasciculus, seems to be placed
beyond doubt; his style is very different, and his tone of sentiment
directly at variance with what is found in the preceding portion. He
is a devoted admirer of Henry V, a characteristic which no one will
ascribe to the writer of the preceding
page.<a id="notetag314" name="notetag314"></a><a href="#note314">[314]</a></p>

<p>This writer had composed his history before the year 1418; for of Sir
John Oldcastle he says, "that he broke prison after his condemnation,
and lurked in caves and hiding-places, <i>and is still
lurking</i>."<a id="notetag315" name="notetag315"></a><a href="#note315">[315]</a>
This portion of the MS. offers evidence in almost every page that its
author was an eye-witness of what he describes. Probably no
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page428" name="page428">(p. 428)</a></span>
doubt will be entertained that it is the genuine production of an
ecclesiastic in attendance on the King. But his work evidently ceases
at page 72, where he offers a prayer that the Almighty "would give
good success to his master, then going on his second expedition, and
grant him victory as he had twice before; and fill him with the spirit
of wisdom, and heavenly strength, and holy fear."</p>

<p>After the close of the Chaplain's narrative, the MS. loses almost all
its interest: it carries on the history through the first years of the
reign of Henry VI, and is evidently only part of what the volume once
contained.<a id="notetag316" name="notetag316"></a><a href="#note316">[316]</a></p>

<p class="p2">

<p>The two former portions of the volume now claim our careful
examination; and, of these two, especially the second.</p>

<p>It has been already intimated, that the first part of the MS. contains
that portion of the history of Richard II. and Henry IV. which is
embraced by the memoirs of the Monk of Evesham. A careful examination
of both, and a comparison of each with the other, have induced the
Author to conclude (with what degree of probability he must leave
others to decide) that the writer had the work of the Monk before him,
and copied from it very largely, but made such alterations as we
should expect to find made by a <i>foreigner</i>, and one whose feelings
were <i>opposed to the Lancastrian party</i>; a supporter rather of the
cause of Richard, and the French, and the other enemies of
Bolinbroke's house. The Monk's work bears every mark of being the
genuine production of one who witnessed Henry IV.'s expeditions to
Wales, and who was in all his sentiments and prejudices an Englishman
and a Lancastrian. The Author fears he may be considered too minute
and tedious on this point; but, since the circumstance of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page429" name="page429">(p. 429)</a></span>
the writer of the manuscript bear immediately upon the authenticity of
the charge, he trusts he shall be excused a detail which, except for
that consideration, would be superfluous.</p>

<p>1. They both record the execution of a Welshman, who preferred death
to treachery. The Monk adds this comment: "<i>We English</i> too [possumus
et <i>nos Angli</i>] may derive an example here; to preserve our fidelity,
&amp;c. even to death." The MS. thus expresses its comment: "<i>All English
servants</i> may contemplate an example of fidelity towards their own
masters from the conduct of that Welshman."</p>

<p>2. Thus too, in mentioning the introduction of the fashion into
England of wearing long sleeves like a <i>bagpipe</i>, the two MSS. of the
Monk most clearly write "Bagpipe." Of the MSS. in question, the Sloane
writes Bagebyte, the Reg. "Babepipæ;"&mdash;evidently the writer in neither
case knowing the meaning of the English word which he attempted so
unsuccessfully to copy.</p>

<p>3. In relating the capture of Lord Grey, the Monk adds, "which we
grieve to say." The MS., without any such, expression of sympathy or
sorrow, says that "he fell into the snare which he had prepared for
others."<a id="notetag317" name="notetag317"></a><a href="#note317">[317]</a></p>

<p>4. The Monk merely records the return of Isabel to France; the MS.
reflects strongly on her return <i>without her dower</i>, and her feelings
of repugnance against receiving any boon from Henry, whom she regarded
as <i>Richard's enemy</i>.</p>

<p>5. Speaking of the battle of Homildon, the Monk says, "Of <i>our
countrymen</i> only five were slain;" and adds, "We praise thee, O God,
because thou hast been mindful of us." The MS. says, "<i>And of the
English</i> scarcely five were slain;" but adds no word of praise.</p>

<p>6. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page430" name="page430">(p. 430)</a></span>
The Monk says, "From this time Owyn's cause seemed to grow
and prosper, <i>ours</i> to decrease." This is omitted in the MS.</p>

<p>7. Whereas the Monk (describing the character of Richard in the very
words&mdash;and many are unusual words&mdash;adopted by the MS.) records that
Richard was in the habit of sitting throughout the night till the
morning in drinking, and "other occupations not to be named:" the MS.
omits the latter phrase. The Monk says there were <i>two</i> points of
excellence in Richard's character; the MS., though confining itself to
the two specified by the Monk, calls them "very many," "<i>plura</i>."</p>

<p>8. In recording the commencement of Owyn Glyndowr's rebellion, the
Monk, speaking of it as "an execrable revolt," says that the Welsh
elected Owyn against the principles of peace [contra pacem elegerunt].
The MS. says that the Welsh elected a respectable and venerable
gentleman to be their leader and prince.</p>

<p>Our attention is now especially called to some points in which the MS.
seems to be so full of historical mistakes and improbabilities as to
render any statement of a fact, especially of an improbable fact, not
supported by other evidence,
suspicious.<a id="notetag318" name="notetag318"></a><a href="#note318">[318]</a></p>

<p>1. Froissart
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page431" name="page431">(p. 431)</a></span>
(who appears to be well acquainted with the
proceedings of Bolinbroke till he left the coast of France, but to
have been altogether mistaken as to his proceedings from that hour,)
states, with the greatest probability, that Bolinbroke left Paris
under plea of visiting his friend the Duke of Brittany, and having
been well received and assisted by him, set sail from some port of
Brittany [intimating that his embarkation was (as was natural) carried
on in secret, for he "<i>had only been informed</i>" that it was from
Vennes].<a id="notetag319" name="notetag319"></a><a href="#note319">[319]</a>
The MS., on the contrary, with the greatest
improbability, roundly asserts that Bolinbroke went to Calais,
obtained money from the treasurer, though against his will, and seized
all the ships which he could find in the port. The improbability that
Bolinbroke should have excited the suspicions of the authorities of
Calais not in his interest, from which a single boat in a few hours
could have carried the news of his hostile attempts to Richard's
friends in England, and the absurdity of making him seize all the
ships in the port of Calais to carry over his handful of friends, can
impress the reader with no favourable idea of this writer's accuracy.</p>

<p>2. No fact is more undeniably certain than that Henry IV. made his
eldest son (our Henry V.) Prince of Wales and Duke of Cornwall in the
parliament held immediately upon his accession; whereas the MS.
declares that Henry V. was so created in the year of the Emperor of
Constantinople's visit
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page432" name="page432">(p. 432)</a></span>
to England, and in the parliament
which began at the feast of St. Hilary, during which Sautre was burned
for a heretic;&mdash;that is, a year and a quarter later.</p>

<p>3. The MS. account of Hotspur's rebellion is quite inconsistent with
facts, and altogether, in other respects, as improbable as it is
singular. The MS. says that
Hotspur,<a id="notetag320" name="notetag320"></a><a href="#note320">[320]</a>
about Candlemas, was
commissioned to go against the Welsh rebels; but when he reached the
country with his forces, and found it to be mountainous, and fit
neither for horse nor infantry, he made a truce with Owyn, and went to
London to take the King's pleasure upon it. The reception he met with
at court drove him to his own country; and the King, as soon as he
heard of Percy gathering his people, collected those whom he believed
to be faithful to him, and hastened to meet him near Shrewsbury.
Whereas the fact is, that Henry Percy had been resident as Chief
Justice in North Wales, Constable of Caernarvon, &amp;c. at least three
years; had besieged Conway with his own men; had routed the rebels at
Cader Idris, and most zealously persevered in his attempts to suppress
the rebellion; and had returned from the Principality at least a year
and a half before the Candlemas (1403), at which the MS. says that he
was first commissioned to go there.</p>

<p>The next point to which the attention of the reader is solicited will
perhaps be considered by many to involve a greater improbability than
the Author may himself attach to it. Every one who has ever read, or
heard, or written about the "Tripartite Indenture of Division" made
between Glyndowr, Mortimer, and Northumberland, fixes it,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page433" name="page433">(p. 433)</a></span> as
Shakspeare does, before the battle of
Shrewsbury.<a id="notetag321" name="notetag321"></a><a href="#note321">[321]</a>
The scene in
the house of the Archdeacon of Bangor is too exquisite for any one to
desire it to be proved a fable. But (as the Author believes) this MS.
is the only document extant which professes to record the words of
that treaty; and yet this document fixes it to a date long after the
Percies lost that "sorry field." It is represented to have been made
in the February of the year of Pope Innocent's election: if before
that election, it was made in 1404; if after it, in 1405. And
certainly the tradition is general that Northumberland, after his
flight to Scotland, visited Wales.</p>

<p>Another point deserving consideration is the account of the conspiracy
of Mowbray and the Archbishop of York. That account is drawn up in a
manner most unfavourable to Henry IV. The MS. boldly also records the
miracle wrought in the field of the Archbishop's execution, and states
that various miracles attracted multitudes to his tomb daily. It also
affirms that, on the very day and hour of the Archbishop's execution,
Henry IV. was struck with the
leprosy.<a id="notetag322" name="notetag322"></a><a href="#note322">[322]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps too it may appear strange to others, as the Author confesses
it has appeared to himself, that, up to the very last chapter of this
history of Richard II. and Henry IV, no mention whatever is made of
Henry of Monmouth, except in the unaccountable anachronism of his
creation as Prince of Wales. It is curious that an historian should
state that the young Duke of Gloucester was sent for from Ireland, and
not allude to the circumstance of the Prince being in prison with him,
and being sent for back at the same
time.<a id="notetag323" name="notetag323"></a><a href="#note323">[323]</a></p>

<p>We <span class="pagenum"><a id="page434" name="page434">(p. 434)</a></span>
are now arrived at the very last chapter, the chapter
containing the charge on which Henry of Monmouth's character has been
so severely, and, if that charge be true, so justly arraigned. The
chapter professes to record the transactions of the thirteenth year of
Henry IV. The question is one of such essential importance as far as
Henry's good name is at stake, and (as the Author cannot but think) in
point too of the philosophy of history, involving principles of such
deep interest to the genuine pursuer of truth, that he would not feel
himself justified were he to abstain from transcribing the whole
chapter.</p>

<p>"In the thirteenth year there was a great disturbance between the Duke
of Burgundy and the Duke of Orleans. Wherefore the Duke of Burgundy
sent to the Lord Henry, Prince of
England,<a id="notetag324" name="notetag324"></a><a href="#note324">[324]</a>
for aid to oppose the
Duke of Orleans: who sent to his succour the Earl Arundell, John
Oldcastle the Lord of Cobham, the Lord Gilbert Umfravill, the Lord of
Kyme, and with them a great army; by whose prowess at Senlow [Reg.
'Senlowe'], near Paris, the Duke of Orleans was vanquished, and
cruelly routed from the field, and his followers crushed, routed, and
slain. And the same Duke of Orleans thought how he could avenge
himself against the Duke of Burgundy; and immediately he sent to King
Henry of England a great sum of gold, together with William Count
Anglam [Reg. "de Anglam"], his brother, as a hostage or surety for a
greater sum, to obtain succour from the King of England himself. And
the King did not put off sending him succour; and he appointed Lord
Thomas, his second son, Duke of Clarence, and conferred on him the
dukedom (or, as it was of old time, the earldom) of Albemarle; and
Edmund, who before
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page435" name="page435">(p. 435)</a></span>
was Duke of Albemarle, then, after the
death of his father, he advanced to be Duke of York. And Lord John
Cornwall, who married his sister, the Duchess of Exeter, and whom the
King appointed Captain of Calais, he sent towards the parts of France
with a great power of men. And when they landed in Normandy, near
Hogges, forthwith the Lord de Hambe, with seven thousand armed men,
went up against the English to oppose them, and thus on that day there
was a great slaughter of men; for on the part of the Duke of Burgundy
eight hundred men were taken, and four hundred slain: and thus at
length victory was on the side of the English. After which the Duke,
with his army, turned off towards the country of
Bourdeaux,<a id="notetag325" name="notetag325"></a><a href="#note325">[325]</a>
[               ] destroying [               ] of the countrymen,
collecting great sums of money, at length arrived at Bourdeaux, and
from thence they returned to England about the vintage."</p>

<p>The reader's especial attention is here called to the confusion of
facts and dates, the mistakes historical, geographical, chronological,
biographical, with which this short section abounds to the overflow.
It will perhaps be difficult to find a page in any author, ancient or
modern, more full of such blunders as tend to destroy confidence in
him, when he records as a fact what is not found in any other writer,
nor is supported by ancillary evidence. The MS. states that all these
events took place in the thirteenth year of Henry IV: the MS. writes
it at length, "Anno decimo tertio," which began on the 20th September
1411. Now, allowing to the writer every latitude not involving
positive confusion, it is impossible for us to suppose, when he
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page436" name="page436">(p. 436)</a></span>
crowds all these events within one year, that he had any such
information on the affairs of England as would predispose us to regard
him as an authority.</p>

<p>1. The first application by the Duke of Burgundy for English
auxiliaries was in August 1411; and the battle of St. Cloud (the place
which the MS., evidently ignorant of its situation and name, calls
Senlow) was fought on the 10th of November 1411. The Duke of Orleans,
at the beginning of the following year, 1412, made his application to
the English court for aid against the Duke of Burgundy, but it was not
till the 18th of May 1412 that the final treaty was concluded between
Henry IV. and the Duke of Orleans; and it was not till the middle, or
the latter end of August 1412, that the Duke of Clarence was
despatched to aid the Duke of Orleans; and he remained in France till
he received news of his father's death, in April 1413; when, and not
before, he returned to England after his expedition to aid the Duke of
Orleans.<a id="notetag326" name="notetag326"></a><a href="#note326">[326]</a>
Yet all these events are stated in the MS. to have
fallen within the same
year.<a id="notetag327" name="notetag327"></a><a href="#note327">[327]</a></p>

<p>2. The MS. says that the English, after their victory over the Duke of
Burgundy's forces, returned to England at the time of vintage. The
English returned to England at the end of autumn; not after their
struggle against the Duke of Burgundy, but after their victory over
the Duke of Orleans at the bridge of St. Cloud, a year and a quarter
at least before their return from the expedition against the Duke of
Burgundy.</p>

<p>3. Again, the MS. says that the Duke of Orleans sent, immediately
after the battle of St. Cloud (the Senlow of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page437" name="page437">(p. 437)</a></span>
MS.), a
large sum of money to the King of England, together with his brother,
the Earl of Angouleme, as a hostage or pledge for the payment of a
greater sum, to induce the King to comply with his request. This is
utter confusion. The Earl was sent as an hostage,&mdash;not beforehand, to
induce Henry IV. to send auxiliaries,&mdash;but afterwards, to insure the
payment of large sums which the Duke of Orleans stipulated to pay to
the English after they had been some time in France, on condition of
their quitting it. The Earl of Angouleme was sent as an hostage to
England somewhat before January 25, 1413; the MS. says, at the end of
1411.</p>

<p>4. Again, the MS. having dated the death of John, Earl of Somerset,
Captain of Calais, in the preceding year, says that the King then made
John Cornwall Captain of Calais. Whereas the fact is, that John
Beaufort, Captain of Calais, died on Palm Sunday, 1410, and Prince
Henry was appointed to succeed him on the following Tuesday. His
appointment, by writ of privy seal, bears date March 18, 1410; and he
continued to be Captain of Calais till he succeeded to the throne.</p>

<p>The MS. having recorded the marriage of the Duke of Clarence with the
Countess of Somerset, and the dispute between him and the Bishop of
Winchester, in which Prince Henry took the Bishop's part against his
brother, as having taken place in this same year, proceeds with the
passage, for the purpose of ascertaining the accuracy and authenticity
of which we have been led to make so many prefatory observations.</p>

<p>"In the same
year,<a id="notetag328" name="notetag328"></a><a href="#note328">[328]</a>
on the morrow of All Souls, began a parliament
at Westminster; and because the King, by reason of his infirmity,
could not in his own person be present,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page438" name="page438">(p. 438)</a></span>
he appointed and
ordained in his name his brother, Thomas Beaufort, then Chancellor of
England, to open, continue, and prorogue it. In which parliament
Prince Henry desired from his father the resignation of his kingdom
and crown, because that his father, by reason of his malady, could not
labour for the honour and advantage of the kingdom any longer; but in
this he was altogether unwilling to consent to him,&mdash;nay, he wished to
govern the kingdom, together with the crown and its appurtenances, as
long as he retained his vital breath. Whence the Prince, in a manner,
with his counsellors retired aggrieved; and afterwards, as it were
through the greater part of England, he joined all the nobles under
his authority in homage and pay. In the same parliament the money, as
well in gold as in silver, was somewhat lessened in weight in
consequence of the exchange of foreigners, &amp;c."</p>

<p>Now, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page439" name="page439">(p. 439)</a></span>
there can be no doubt (1) that a parliament was held on
the morrow of All Souls, in the thirteenth year of Henry IV. (1411);
(2) that it was <i>opened</i>, <i>continued</i>, and <i>prorogued</i> by Thomas
Beaufort, the Chancellor, by commission from the King, in his absence;
(3) that an alteration in the coin was agreed upon in that parliament;
and (4), moreover, that the King declared in that parliament his
determination to allow of no innovations, nor of any encroachments on
his prerogative, but to maintain the rights and privileges of his
crown in full enjoyment, as his royal predecessors had delivered them
down.</p>

<p>A superficial glance at these facts would doubtless suggest a strong
confirmation of the details of the MS. in other points, and thus
predispose us to receive the statement with regard to Prince Henry's
unfilial conduct on the authority of this document alone. But, on
close examination, these very facts, which the records of the realm
place beyond doubt, coupled with others equally indisputable, to which
we shall presently refer, demonstrate to the Author's mind that no
dependence whatever can be placed on this MS., and that the statement
is altogether apocryphal, and founded on palpable confusion.</p>

<p>The parliament met on the morrow of All Souls, Tuesday, November 3,
1411, (13th Henry IV,) and was opened, continued, and prorogued by the
Chancellor; but not on account of the King's indisposition, or
inability to be present. The Rolls of Parliament are most explicit on
this point. They state that the King, having been informed that very
many lords, spiritual and temporal, knights of the shire, and
burgesses, who ought to attend that parliament, had not assembled on
the appointed day, commissions the Chancellor to open the parliament,
and to prorogue it <i>till the following day</i>. And on the following day,
Wednesday, (the Lords and Commons then being in the presence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page440" name="page440">(p. 440)</a></span>
of the King,) the Chancellor, by the King's command, recited the
reasons for convening the parliament, and charged the Commons to
retire and elect their Speaker.</p>

<p>Not only so. On the Thursday (Nov. 5), the Commons came before the
King and the Lords, and presented Thomas Chaucer as their Speaker. And
the Speaker prayed liberty of speech, &amp;c.: and the King granted the
request, but declared that he would admit of no innovation nor
encroachment on his prerogative, but resolved to maintain his rights
as fully as his predecessors had done. On this the Speaker prayed him
to grant to the Commons, till the day following, time for putting
their protest, &amp;c. in writing. To this the King agreed. But, forasmuch
as the King could not attend on the Friday in consequence of diverse
great and pressing matters, the time was postponed to the following
day, Saturday; when the Commons came before the King, and presented
their prayer, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The fact is, that the King was repeatedly present at this parliament,
from the day before the Speaker was chosen to the very last day. On a
subsequent occasion, the Prince of Wales also, as well as the King, is
recorded to have been present, (as doubtless he was on various
occasions throughout,&mdash;probably an habitual attendant,) in what
character, and under what circumstances, whether as the supplanter of
his father or not, perhaps the words of the record may, to a certain
extent at least, enable us to pronounce.</p>

<p>"On Monday, the last day of November, the Speaker, in the name of the
Commons, prayed the King to thank my Lord the Prince, the Bishops of
Winchester and Durham, &amp;c. who were assigned to be of council to the
King in the last parliament, for their great labour and diligence;
for, as it appears to the said Commons, my said Lord the Prince, and
the other Lords, have well and loyally done their duty according to
their promise in that parliament. And upon that, kneeling, my Lord the
Prince, and the other
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page441" name="page441">(p. 441)</a></span>
Lords, declared, by the mouth of my
Lord the Prince, how they had taken pains, and labour, and diligence,
according to their promise, and the charge given them in parliament,
to their skill and knowledge. This the King remembered well [or made
good mention of], and thanked them most graciously. And he said
besides, that he was well assured, if they had had more than they had,
in the manner it had been spoken by the mouth of my Lord the Prince,
at the time the King charged them to be of his council in the said
parliament, they would have done their duty to effect more good than
was done in diverse parts for the defence, honour, good, and profit of
him and his kingdom. And our Lord the King also said, that he felt
very contented with their good and loyal diligence, counsel, and duty,
for the time they had been of his council."</p>

<p>This took place on the 30th of November, a month (saving two days)
after the parliament had assembled, and within less than three weeks
of its termination. It would scarcely be credible, even had the report
come through a less questionable channel, that Henry of Monmouth up to
that time had been guilty of the unfilial delinquency with which the
MS. charges him. Nor could he have made the "unnatural attempt to
dethrone his diseased father" at any period through the remaining
three weeks of the session of that parliament. At all events, such a
proceeding appears altogether irreconcilable with the conduct both of
the parliament and of the King on the very last day of their sitting.
"On Saturday, December 20th, (say the Rolls,) being the last day of
parliament, the Speaker, recommending the persons of the Queen, of the
Prince, and of other the King's sons, prayeth the advancement of their
estates; for the which the King giveth hearty thanks."</p>

<p>Had any such transaction taken place during this parliament as the MS.
records, would the King, on the last day of the session, without any
allusion to it, have given hearty thanks to the Commons for their
recommendation of the Prince's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page442" name="page442">(p. 442)</a></span>
person (coupled with the name
of his Queen and his other sons), and their prayer for further
provision for his dignity and comfort?</p>

<p>There are, however, two or three more circumstances upon which it may
appear material to make some observations; or even, should these
closing observations not seem altogether indispensable, yet, since
this is all new and untrodden ground, it may yet be thought safer to
anticipate conjectures, than to leave any questions unopened and
unexamined on this point&mdash;a point which the Author trusts may be set
at rest at once, and for ever.</p>

<p>The Author then is ready to confess his belief that both the MS. and
its commentator, the modern historian, have confounded this parliament
of November 1411 with the parliament of February 3, 1413, which was
opened in the illness of the King, and which he never was able to
attend. But if it be attempted to engraft on this fact the surmise
that it might have been in the latter parliament that the Prince
demanded the surrender of the throne, and that it is after all a mere
mistake of dates, the material fact being unshaken and unaffected,&mdash;to
this suggestion he replies, that there is no evidence, directly or
indirectly bearing on the subject, in support of such a surmise. The
only statement in printed book or manuscript known, is that which we
have now been sifting; and which with a precision, as though of set
purpose, minute and pointed, fixes the alleged transaction to the year
1411.<a id="notetag329" name="notetag329"></a><a href="#note329">[329]</a>
Not only so. We have, on the contrary, reason to believe
that before the meeting of the next parliament, February 1413, <i>all
differences had been made up between the King and his son</i>; and that
from the day of their reconciliation they lived in the full
interchange of paternal and filial kindness to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page443" name="page443">(p. 443)</a></span>
end. For
that jealousies and alienations of confidence, fostered by the
malevolence of
others,<a id="notetag330" name="notetag330"></a><a href="#note330">[330]</a>
had taken place between them in the course
of the preceding year, the very mention of the "ridings of gentils and
huge people with the Prince," twice recurring in the Chronicle of
London, seems of itself to force upon us. The accounts, at all events,
such as they are, which chroniclers give of their reconciliation, fix
the date of that happy issue of their estrangement to a period
antecedent to the last parliament of Henry IV. February 3.&mdash;Cras.
Purif. 1413.</p>

<p>Although the life and reign of Henry IV. continued more than a year
and four months after the passing of the ordinance respecting the
coin, with an account of which this MS. abruptly closes, yet
(excepting what is involved in the extract above cited) not one single
word is said of the foreign and domestic affairs of the kingdom, or of
the life of the King, or of his death; though much of interesting
matter was at hand, and though a parliament was summoned, and actually
met fourteen months after the alteration of the coin. And such is the
close of a document, not like a yearly chronicle, or general register
of events, satisfied with giving a summary of the most remarkable
casualties in the briefest form; but a narrative which transcribes,
with unusual minuteness, the very words (at full, and with all their
technicalities,) of some of the most unimportant and prolix statutes
of Henry IV.'s
reign.<a id="notetag331" name="notetag331"></a><a href="#note331">[331]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page444" name="page444">(p. 444)</a></span>
It is not that the MS. is
mechanically cut short by loss of leaves, or other accident; the
Sloane ends with an "etc." in the very middle of a page, and the
King's at the foot of the first column.</p>

<p>We need not encumber this inquiry (already too long) by any
reflections on the avidity with which this passage of the MS. has been
seized, and made the groundwork of charges against Henry of "unfilial
conduct," "unnatural rebellion" towards his father, and "the
unprincipled ambition of a Catilinarian temper," with other hard words
and harder surmises; because we are trying the value of testimony. If
that testimony is sound, modern historians may doubtless build upon it
what comments seem to them good; if we utterly destroy the validity of
the evidence, their foundation sinks from under their superstructure.</p>

<p>The reader, however, has probably already determined that, unless
there be in reserve some other independent, or at least auxiliary
source of evidence, the palpable contradiction and manifest confusion
reigning through this part of the MS., together with the high degree
of improbability thrown over the whole statement by the undoubted
records of the very parliament in question, justify the rejection of
the passage altogether from the pale of authentic history. The Author
confesses that he has step by step come to that conclusion.</p>

produced such an entire confidence in him, that both houses of
parliament in an address offered to swear allegiance to him before he

exhorted them in their several places and stations to employ all their
power for the good of the nation. He told them that he began his reign
in pardoning all that had offended him, and with such a desire for his
people's happiness, that he would be crowned on no other condition
than to make use of all his authority to promote it; and prayed God
that, if he foresaw he was like to be any other than a just and good

<b>Footnote 13:</b> Many original petitions addressed to Henry are still
preserved among our records. In one, which may serve as a specimen of
the kind of application to which this custom compelled him to open his
ear, Richard Hunt appeals to him as a "right merciable lord, moved
with pity, mercy, and grace." "In great desolation and heaviness of
heart," the petitioner states that his son-in-law, Richard Peke, who
had a wife and four children, and had been all his life a true
labourer and innocent man, and well-beloved by his neighbours, had
been detected in taking from a vessel goods not worth three shillings;
for which crime his mortal enemies (though they might have their
property again) "sued to have him dead." He urges Henry to grant him
"full noble grace," at the reverence of Almighty God, and for passion
that Christ suffered for all mankind, and for the pity that he had on
Mary Magdalene. The petitioner then promised (as petitioners now do)
to pray for endless mercy on Henry; he adds, moreover, what would
certainly sound strange in a modern petition to a monarch, "And ye,
gracious and sovereign lord, shall have a good ox to your larder."
Henry granted the petition. "The King woll that this bill pass without
any manner of fine, or fees that longeth to him."<a

<b>Footnote 19:</b> In a previous section of these Memoirs, brief mention has
been made of the abortive attempt to carry off into Wales this young
Earl of March and his brother, and of the generous conduct of Henry of
Monmouth in his endeavour to restore the Duke of York to the King's
favour, which he had forfeited in consequence of his alleged
participation in that bold design. A manuscript has since been brought
under the Author's notice, which places in a very strong light the
treasonable and murderous purpose of those who originated the plot,
and would account for the most watchful and jealous caution on the
part of the reigning family against a repetition of such attempts.
Henry must have been fully aware of his danger; and the fact of his
throwing off all suspicion towards the young Earl, and receiving him
with confidence and friendship, enhances our estimate of the generous
and noble spirit which actuated him. The document, in other points
curious, seems to deserve a place here:</p>

<b>Footnote 28:</b> Henry had much at heart the maintenance of the truth of

to have given early proof, by confirming a grant of fifty marks
yearly, during pleasure, to the prior and convent of the order of
Preachers in the University of Oxford, to support the doctrine of the
Catholic faith. It will be said that this was merely to repress the
Lollards. Be it so, though the original document is silent on that
point. It proves, at least, that he wished to maintain his religion by
argument rather than by violence. The circumstance, however, of its
being merely a confirmation of a grant, which even his father found in
existence when he became King, takes away much from the importance of
the fact.&mdash;Pell Rolls, 1 Henry IV.<a href="#notetag028">(back)</a></p>

<b>Footnote 38:</b> Some persons would probably be surprised, among the facts

promotion, according to our usual ideas of episcopal preferment, a
Bishop of London, Nicoll Bubwith, was translated from London to
Salisbury, and from Salisbury to Bath and Wells. The pleading also
reminds us of a curious fact with regard to Bishop Hallam's promotion,
not generally known. The record merely states that "the Bishop of
Sarum, that now is, was translated from York to the church of Sarum."
This latter translation, however, (if such it can be properly called,)
admits of a more easy solution than the preceding. The fact is, that
Hallam was actually appointed by the Pope to the archbishopric of
York; to which appointment the King objected. The nomination of the
Pope was not persisted in, and Hallam was consecrated Bishop of
Salisbury.<a href="#notetag038">(back)</a></p>

<b>Footnote 42:</b> It is very painful to reflect on the intolerant spirit of
this very Sigismund, who was so anxious to reform the abuses of the
church; but it is forced upon us whilst we are inquiring into the
times of Henry. Sigismund had paid (as we shall see) a visit to Henry,
and he meditated another. But he never put that design into execution.
A letter from Heretong Van Clux, Henry's minister, informed his master
that he must not expect to see the Emperor, for he had employment at
home in putting down the followers of Huss. "Now I know well he might
not come, for this cause, that many of the great lords of Bohemia have
required him for to let them hold the same belief that they are in.
And thereupon he sent them word, that rather he would be dead than he
would sustain them in their malice. And they have answered him again,
that they will rather die than go from their belief. There is a great
power of them, lords, knights, and esquires; but the greatest power is
of the commoners. Therefore the Emperor gathers all the power that he
may, to go into Bohemia upon them."&mdash;See Ellis's Original Letters.<a

strong testimony. This same Cardinal had a personal interview with
Henry in 1418, just before the taking of Rouen.</p>

<p>Le Neve leaves it in doubt whether Bishop Hallam was buried at
Constance, or in Westminster Abbey. But the Author has been kindly
furnished by Sir Francis Palgrave, who visited Constance last year,
with the following interesting particulars relative to the
resting-place of that excellent man. "The monument of Bishop Hallam
consists of a slab inlaid with brass, in the usual style of English
memorials of the same period, but quite unlike those of Germany; and I
have no doubt but that the brasses were sent from England. He is
represented at full length in the episcopal dress, his head lying
between two shields, the royal arms of England within the Garter, (as
Chancellor of the order,) and his own bearings. But the tomb being
placed exactly in front of the high altar, the attrition to which it
has been exposed in this part of the church has nearly effaced the
engravings." His funeral, we are told, was attended by the assembled

the University of Oxford in favour of Wickliff and his doctrines,
refers to this Bishop Hallam, though with some mistake. "The prime
broacher," he says, "of this testimonial, of which we have nothing in
our registers, records, or books of epistles, was John Husse in the
first tome of his works, and from him John Fox. Against the former of
whom it was objected in the Council of Constance, that he had openly
divulged the said commendatory letter in behalf of John Wickliff,
falsely conveyed to Prague, under the title of the University of
Oxford, by two students, one a Bohemian, the other an Englishman.
Whereupon those of England who were present at the council, of whom,
if I mistake not, Robert Hallam, about these times Bishop of Oxford
[Salisbury], was one, produce another letter under the seal of the
University, wherein, on the contrary, the members thereof as much
denounce against him as the other was in behalf of him, and referred
the matter to the council to judge of it as they thought fit; but how
it was decided I find not."<a href="#notetag045">(back)</a></p>

<b>Footnote 46:</b> In his arguments on this article Dr. Ullerston offers
some excellent reflections upon the use and abuse of singing in the
church. The sentiments of Augustin, which he quotes, are truly
judicious and edifying. That eloquent father lamented that often the
beauty of the singing withdrew his mind from the divine matter and
substance of what was sung; but when he remembered how, on occasions
of peculiar interest to him, psalmody carried his soul towards heaven
in holy raptures, he could not help voting for its continuance in the
church service. Ullerston quotes also two lines, not indeed specimens
of classical accuracy, but the spirit of which should never be absent
from the mind of a Christian worshipper, whether a Protestant or in
communion with the see of Rome:</p>

all our ancient documents, whether published or yet in manuscript, in
the cause of historical truth; and he sincerely trusts that not one

capable of embellishing and adorning his history. The reader is

principal work in which these letters are found as the production of
M. Laboureur. Into this error he might easily be led by the manner in
which the book has been quoted. Laboureur translated the work of an
anonymous writer of St. Denis, of whose character nothing is known.

title of his chapter directs our attention to the point. "Henry, King
of England, constrained by his subjects to renew his pretension to the
crown of France, makes a great movement." "The present year, on the
incidents of which I proceed to remark, seems to me not less full of
troubles and evils than any of those which preceded it. It commenced
by a rumour, sudden but true, and which spread itself everywhere, that
the English, impatient of repose, blaming for carelessness and want of
heart the repose and inactivity of their King Henry, had <i>compelled
him</i> to arouse himself, and to revive by the same means the
pretensions of some of his predecessors on the crown of France." "Les
Anglais, impatiens de repos à leur ordinance, blâmans de nonchalance
et de manque de coeur le repos et l'oisiveté de leur Roi Henri,
l'avaient obligé de se reveiller."&mdash;M. Laboureur, Life of Charles VI,
translated from the Latin of a contemporary ecclesiastic. Whatever be
the degree of authority to which this author is entitled, whilst he

<b>Footnote 79:</b> Among the records of the council, the minutes of one of
their meetings held at Westminster in the second year of Henry's reign
deserve especial attention. The manuscript is much damaged, but the
general meaning is clearly intelligible. The minutes first rehearse
that "the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the true and humble lieges
and knights of the King's noble realm, were there present, gathered by
his royal command." It then proceeds: "Ye, our noble and righteous
Lord and King, have in your chivalrous heart and desire determined to
stir and labour in your recovery and redintegration of the old rights
of your crown, as well as for your righteous heritage ... desiring
upon this knightful intent and purpose to have the good and high
advice and true meaning of us, your true knights and humble lieges
aforesaid. Whereupon, our sovereign Lord, as well our Lords as we have
communed by your high commandment in these matters: and known well
among us all without [doubt ye are] so Christian a Prince that ye
would in so high a matter begin nothing but that were to God's
pleasance, and to eschew by all ways the shedding of Christian blood;
and that, if algate [at all events] ye should do it, that denying of
right and reason were the cause [rather] than wilfulheadedness.
Wherefore, our sovereign and gracious high Lord, it thinks, as well
our Lords as us in our own hearts, that it were speedful to send such
ambassadors to every party as [your] claim requireth, sufficiently
instructed for the right and recovery of that is above said. And if
ye, our sovereign Lord, at the reverence of God, like of your proper
motion, without our counsel given thereto, any mesne [middle] way to
offer, that were moderating of your whole title, or of any of your
claims beyond the sea; and hereupon your adverse party denying you
both right and reason and all reasonable mesne [middle] ways, we trust
all in God's grace that all your works in pursuing them should take
the better speed and conclusion: and in the mean while that all the
works of readiness that may be to your voyage thought or wrought, that
it be done by the high advice of you and your noble council; seeing
that the surety of your royal estate, the peace of your land, the safe
ward of all your [realm] be well and sufficiently provided for above
all things. And, these observed, we shall be ready with our bodies and
goods, to do you the service that we may to our powers, as far as we
ought of right, and as our ancestors have done to your noble
progenitors in like case."</p>

<p>This advice appears to have been followed by Henry throughout.</p>

<p>The Minutes of Council, February 2, 1415, after stating the measures
proposed for the safeguard of the sea, and the marches of Scotland and
Wales, &amp;c. during the King's absence, record this remarkable
advice: that Henry would direct his treasurer to bring a clear
statement of his debtor and creditor account, the demands of the
treasury, and the income; also the debts incurred since the
coronation, and the annuities to which he was pledged; "in order that,
before the departure of the King, such provision may be made in every
part, according to the amount of the charges, that the mind and soul
of the King might be set at ease and comfort, that he might depart
like a Christian Prince with a good government, and the better
accomplish his voyage, to the pleasure of God, and the singular
comfort of all his faithful lieges."&mdash;Acts of Privy Council, vol. ii.

hath exalted,&mdash;with what gifts of especial grace He hath abundantly
filled you,&mdash;so that even your enemies proclaim your wisdom, admire
and everywhere extol your discretion, and celebrate your justice by

am compelled to fear the general habits of a nation which very often
has trifled with the publicly plighted vows and their oath solemnly
pledged. And whilst I meditate on past days,&mdash;recalling the frauds,
crimes, factions, and enormities committed by your enemies,&mdash;my soul
is made anxious, and my heart is disquieted within me, and my life has
well-nigh failed from grief, knowing that to-morrow base deeds may be
done as well as yesterday. And fearing lest by any means your
innocence may be circumvented, I revolved in my mind what would best
minister to your safety in the midst of so many dangers. At length it
occurred to me to write something to your Highness (whom my soul
cordially loves) by which you may be made more safe at once and more
cautious. Love conquers all things; ah! it has wrought in me not to
fear, though in an uncultivated and unpolished style, to offer to so
wise and glorious a Prince what I reflected upon in my mind, and to
open to your serene Highness as I best may what I have conceived in my
heart for your royal safety. Hence it is that I have endeavoured to
draw up a brief table of events from the commencement of the conquest
of Neustria [Normandy] by the Normans down to their conquest of
England; which I have carried on to the time when your Majesty, with
power and victory, compelled the same Normandy, alienated against
right and justice from your ancestors for about two hundred and twenty
years, to come under your yoke, and royally to be governed according
to your desire. Wherefore, my redoubted Lord and King, in this little
work I offer to your inspection past deeds, various wars, mutual
covenants of peace; leagues, though confirmed by an oath, violated;
the promises, pledges, offerings, treacherously made to your
predecessors; the deceit and hypocrisy of the enemy; and whatever the
antagonist could with exquisite craftiness invent, by which they might
entrap your noble spirit. Wherefore, since it becomes no one to
possess knowledge more than a Prince, whose learning may be most
beneficial to his subjects,&mdash;I, a poor and humble votary, offer (if it
be your will) this volume to the inspection of your Highness; giving
it the name of Ypodigma Neustriæ, because it especially portrays the
events and falls of that country from the time of Rollo the first Duke
down to the sixth year of your happy reign, which may God Almighty of
his great mercy crown with peace, and preserve in all prosperity!
Amen."<a href="#notetag092">(back)</a></p>

<b>Footnote 130:</b> In the "History of Agincourt," the translator of the

representation than the original will warrant of the sufferings to
which the English troops were exposed through this night of present
fatigue and discomfort, and of anxious preparation for so tremendous a
struggle as awaited them on the morrow. The ecclesiastic, who was
himself among the sufferers, and who has furnished a very graphic
description of the whole affair, says, "The King turned aside to a
small village, where we had houses, but very few indeed, and gardens
and orchards to rest in." "Ubi habuimus domos sed paucissimas,
hortosque et pomaria pro requiescione nostra." This the translator
renders, "Where we had houses to rest in, but very scanty gardens and
orchards." The scanty supply was not of gardens and orchards, but of
houses to rest in. Consequently, except such as those very few houses
could accommodate, the English soldiers were all compelled to bivouac,
exposed to the drenching rains which fell through the night. Of
orchards and gardens there was doubtless an abundant supply, but they
afforded little shelter from the weather, and no means to the troops
of taking refreshing rest.<a href="#notetag130">(back)</a></p>

<p>On the part of the French, Le Fevre says, that from a hundred to six
score princes fell, and about seven or eight thousand of noble blood.
In the Annales Ecclesiastici of Baronius, continued by Raynaldus, the
statement of Theodoric Niemius is quoted, who says (unquestionably
without authority) that Henry advanced from Harfleur with sixty
thousand men, besides two thousand in attendance on the carriages. He
affirms that the French had one hundred thousand men; among whom were
one thousand Italians, commanded by Buligard, who had long governed
Genoa in favour of the French. He says, moreover, that more than five

<b>Footnote 140:</b> Hume, with his usual inaccuracy, asserts that the French
army at Agincourt was headed as well by the Dauphin, as by all the
other princes of the blood. The Dauphin wished to assist his
countrymen, when they resolved to intercept the invaders; but, as we
are expressly told by Le Fevre (c. 59), was not suffered to join the
rendezvous. This is not the only mistake into which Hume has fallen in
his account of this battle. In one paragraph he reports Henry to have
been under the necessity of marching by land from Harfleur to Calais,
in order to reach a place of safety from which he might transport his
soldiers back to England; in another paragraph he represents him (with
the same temerity which had been evinced by his predecessors before
the battles of Poictiers and of Cressy) to have ventured without any
object of moment, and merely for the <i>sake of plunder</i>, so far into
the enemy's country as to leave himself no retreat. He tells us,
moreover, that "Henry was master of fourteen thousand prisoners," whom
he afterwards says that the King "carried with him to Paris, thence to
England." Hume took this also without inquiry. Walsingham says, "Henry
took (as they say&mdash;ut ferunt,&mdash;as though even that estimate required
to be supported by common report,) seven hundred prisoners;" and of
his prisoners, how many soever they were, he transported (as Des
Ursins tells us) only the most considerable to England, dismissing the
rest under promise to bring their ransom to him in the field of Lendi,
on the feast of St. John in the summer, and, if he were not there,
they should be discharged of the debt.<a href="#notetag140">(back)</a></p>

<b>Footnote 141:</b> Of this gallant Welshman, the following account is taken
from the Appendix of the "Battle of Agincourt." "Dr. Meyrick (now Sir
Samuel) says, Davydd Gam, <i>i.e.</i> Squint-eyed David, was a native of
Brecknockshire, and, holding his land of the honour of Hereford, was a
strenuous supporter of the Lancastrian interests. He was the son of
Llewellyn, descended from Einion Sais, who possessed a handsome
property in the parishes of Garthbrengy and Llanddeu. In consequence
of an affray in the high street of Brecknock, in which he
unfortunately killed his kinsman, he was compelled to fly into England
to avoid a threatened prosecution, and became the implacable enemy of
Owain Glyndowr, whom he attempted to assassinate. Gam, it may be
supposed, was his nick-name, as he called himself David Llewellyn; and
there are good grounds for supposing that Shakspeare has caricatured
him in Captain Fluellin. His descendants, however, conceiving that his
prowess more than redeemed his natural defect, took the name of Game.
Sir Walter Raleigh has an eulogium upon his bravery and exploits on
the field of Agincourt, in which he compares him to Hannibal. He was
knighted on the field with his two companions in glory and death, Sir
Roger Vaughan, of Bedwardine in Herefordshire, and Sir Walter, or
rather Watkin Llwyd, of the lordship of Brecknock. Sir Roger had
married Gwladis, the daughter of Sir David Gamme, who survived him,
and became the wife of another hero of Agincourt, Sir William Thomas
of Raglan; and Sir Watkin was by his marriage related to Sir Roger."</p>

<p>The Author gives this passage as he finds it, without having attempted
to verify the statement as to David Gamme's descent or history.
Certainly the testimony which Sir Samuel Meyrick makes Sir Walter
Raleigh bear to his "bravery and exploits on the field of Agincourt,"
cannot be fairly extracted from Sir Walter's own words: "But if
Hannibal himself had been sent forth by Mago to view the Romans, he
could not have returned with a more gallant report in his mouth than
Captain Gamme made unto King Henry the Fifth, saying, 'That of the
Frenchmen there were enow to be killed, enow to be taken prisoners,
and enow to run away!'" We have no doubt of Captain Gamme's gallant
bearing at Agincourt; but Raleigh refers to nothing beyond his report
of the numbers of the enemy.&mdash;Raleigh, book v. sect. 8.<a

<b>Footnote 143:</b> The spot from which the battle of Agincourt took its
name has been confounded with a place named Azincourt, near the town
of Bouchain in French Flanders. On the position of the real field of
battle, and its present condition, the Author has much satisfaction in
making the following extract from a paper read before the Royal
Society of Literature, April 4, 1827, by John Gordon Smith, M.D. who
had visited and examined the spot under circumstances of peculiar
interest:</p>

<p class="letter">"Perhaps I may be pardoned for relating that I had the honour to
receive a Waterloo medal on the field of Azincour, or rather, that I
had the fortune to belong to one of the British regiments that
signalized themselves in the campaign of 1815, and which afterwards
was invested with the above-mentioned mark of their sovereign's
approbation on the very spot which, nearly four hundred years before,
was the scene of the scarcely less glorious triumph of Harry the Fifth
of England. In 1816 a portion of the British army was cantoned in the
immediate neighbourhood of this celebrated field, and the corps in
which I then served made use of it during several months as their
ordinary drill-ground.... We amused ourselves with reconnoitring
excursions, comparing the actual state of the localities with
authentic accounts of the transactions of 1415. The changes that have
taken place have been singularly few, and an attentive explorer would
be able to trace with considerable accuracy the greater part of the
route pursued by the English army in their retreat out of Normandy
towards Calais. The field of Azincour remains sufficiently in statu
quo to render every account of the battle perfectly intelligible; nor
are those wanting near the spot, whose traditionary information
enables them to heighten the interest with oral description,
accompanied by a sort of ocular demonstration.</p>

<p class="letter">"Those who travel to Paris by way of St. Omer and Abbeville, pass over
the field of the battle, which skirts the high road to the left, about
sixteen miles beyond St. Omer; two on the Paris side of a considerable
village or bourg named Fruges; about eight north of the fortified town
of Hesdin; and thirty from Abbeville. All accounts of the battle
mention the hamlet of Ruisseauville, through which very place the high
road to Paris now passes.</p>

<p class="letter">"Azincour is a commune or parish consisting of a most uninteresting
collection of farmers' residences and cottages, once however
distinguished by a castle, of which nothing now remains but the
foundation. The scene of the contest lies between this commune and the
adjoining one of Tramecour, in a wood belonging to which latter the
King concealed those archers whose prowess and vigour contributed so
eminently to the glorious result. Part of the wood still remains;
though, if I remember rightly, at the time of our visit, the corner
into which the bowmen were thrown had been materially thinned, if,
indeed, the original timber had not been entirely cut down, and its
place been scantily supplied by brush or underwood. Some of the trees,
however, in the wood of Tramecour were very old in 1816.</p>

<p class="letter">"The road above mentioned is the great post-road; the old road, now
degenerated into a mere cart-track, from Abbeville to the once
celebrated city of Therouanne, passes over the scene of action, and
must have been that by which the French army reached the ground before
the English, who had been compelled to make a great circuit."&mdash;Vol. i.

<b>Footnote 144:</b> Before his departure from Calais, a dispute arose
between him and two noblemen, who had been taken prisoners at
Harfleur, and set at liberty on condition of surrendering themselves
at Calais. The merits of the case cannot now be known. The one, De
Gaucourt, brought an action against the representatives of the other,
after his death, and after the death of Henry, to recover what he paid
for that other's [D'Estouteville's] ransom. To give a colouring to his
case, he charges Henry with refusing to confirm the stipulations made
by his representatives at Harfleur, and with other harsh conduct. But
an ex parte statement at that time, and under those circumstances, can
form no ground of suspicion against a third party.<a href="#notetag144">(back)</a></p>

which Charles applies to the Provost and Fellows of Oriel College for
a loan of their plate. The King's letter is dated January 6th, 1642;
and the society, assembled in the chapel on the 8th, vote unanimously
to put their silver and gilt vessels at the disposal of their

<b>Footnote 171:</b> Henry's own words, in a letter, 21 July 1418, sent from

to which place came to us the Cardinal of Ursin from our holy father
the Pope, for to treat for the good of peace betwixt both realms, and
is gone again to Paris to diligence there in this same matter; but
what end it shall draw to we wot not as yet." In this letter he
informs us that the attack on Pont de Larche was on the 4th of July;
and that, though the enemy had "assembled in great power to resist us,
yet God of his mercy showed so for us and for our right, that it was
withouten the death of any man's person of ours." He adds that he had
just heard of the decidedly hostile intentions of the Duke of Burgundy
towards him; so "we hold him our full enemy. He is now at Paris." The
King then tells them that he needs not to refer to the death of the
Earl of Armagnac, and the slaughter that hath been at Paris; for he
was assured that they had full knowledge thereof. He alludes to the
massacre of the Armagnac faction by the partisans of the Duke of
Burgundy, June 12, 1418. Two thousand persons were murdered in a very
brief space of time. The mob dragged the bodies of the Constable and

embarking the Prior of Kilmaynham with two hundred horsemen and three
hundred foot-soldiers from Waterford in Ireland, to go to the King in

Stowe give the explanation of this. In 1414, he kept his Lent in the
castle of Kenilworth, and caused an arbour to be planted there in the
marsh for his pleasure, among the thorns and bushes, where a fox
before had harboured; which fox he killed, being a thing then thought

<p>This writer gives us to understand that he and his friends were
heartily tired of the Continental warfare, which had so long kept them
from the comforts of their home, and they longed to revisit the white
cliffs of Britain. "Pray for us, that we may come soon out of this
unlusty [unpleasant] soldier's life, unto the life of England."&mdash;MS.
Donat. 4001. Sir H. Ellis assigns this to the year 1420; but it must
have been written March 27th (the Monday before Passion Sunday), 1419,
just eight days after the Dauphin had broken his word.</p>

<p>The same writer speaks in no very measured terms of the intrigue and
duplicity of foreign courts. "And certes, all the ambassadors that we
deal with are incongrue, that is to say, in old manner of speech in
England, 'they be double and false;' with which manner of men, I pray
God, let never no true men be coupled with."</p>

<p>The reasons which had induced Henry some time previously to wish for
an alliance with the Dauphin are found in the Cot. MS.&mdash;See "Acts of
Privy Council," vol. ii. p. 350.<a href="#notetag187">(back)</a></p></div>

<b>Footnote 188:</b> Katharine of Valois, the youngest child of Charles VI.
of France, (he had twelve children,) was born on the 27th of October
1401; just two months subsequently to her elder sister Isabel's return
from England after the death of her husband, the unfortunate King
Richard. Consequently, at the date of this interview, May 30th, 1419,
she was only in her eighteenth year; Henry himself was in his

<b>Footnote 190:</b> The Author is fully aware that the brief notice he is
able to take of many of the transactions of this period, whether
diplomatic or military, (especially with reference to the proceedings
of the different parties in France,) must leave his readers
unfurnished with information on many points, and in some instances may
cause the accounts which he thought indispensable in this work to
appear obscure and confused. He could not, however, have avoided such
a result of his plan in these Memoirs, without changing their
character altogether. Goodwin, whose labours seem scarcely to have
been ever duly appreciated, has filled up the outline here given,
generally in a satisfactory manner, though many original documents
which have been brought to light since his time have been
employed.<a href="#notetag190">(back)</a></p>

<b>Footnote 192:</b> Goodwin thus comments on his death:&mdash;"Thus fell the Duke
of Burgundy, who, as he had caused the Duke of Orleans to be
assassinated in the streets of Paris, so, <i>by the requital of divine
justice</i>, his own life was abandoned to vile treachery." How very
unwise and unsafe are such comments upon the dispensations of
Providence is most clearly evinced here. Never was a more foul murder,
or more desperate defiance of all law, human and divine, than the
Dauphin was guilty of on the bridge of Montereau: and yet, instead of
"his life being abandoned to vile treachery by the requital of divine
justice," he lived forty-two years after his deed of blood, succeeded
to the throne of his father, rescued his kingdom from the hands of the
English, and died through abstinence from food, self-imposed from fear
of poison. Far more wise and more pious is it to leave such
speculations, and to refer all to that day of final retribution, when
the <i>righteousness of</i> the supreme Ruler of man's destinies shall be
made <i>as clear as the light, and his just dealing as the noon
day</i>.<a href="#notetag192">(back)</a></p>

Durham in 1406. He succeeded Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester, as
Chancellor, on the 23rd of July, 1417, and continued in that office
till July 1424, when Henry Beaufort succeeded him. Thomas Langley was
in possession of the see of Durham from May 17th, 1406, till his death
in November 1437. Dugdale, (Orig. Judic.) by mistake, refers Bishop

10<i>l.</i> to Master Peter Henewer, physician, appointed by the King and
his council to go to the King in Normandy. Probably he felt his
constitution even then giving way. But as early as 13th October 1415,

<p><a id="note195" name="note195"></a>
<b>Footnote 195:</b> A curious and interesting instance of Henry's personal
attention to business in its most minute details, when many of his
subjects would have been quite satisfied with the report of another,
is preserved among some of the driest and most formal acts of the
Privy Council. Certain auditors are instructed to examine, with
greater accuracy than before, the accounts of the late Master of the
Wardrobe; and to make an especial report to the council, most
particularly (potissimè) of such items as they shall find marked in
the King's own hand "ad inquirendum." Reference is also made to those
sums against which a black mark has been placed by the King's hand.
The date of this minute (4th July 1421), and the place (Calais) in
which it states that these accounts were examined by the King, add
considerably to the strength of this example. Henry had then just left
England suddenly on hearing the sad news of a disastrous defeat of
part of his army, and the death of his brother, the Duke of Clarence,
in battle; and he was at Calais on his road to put himself again at
the head of his forces.<a href="#notetag195">(back)</a></p>

College bear internal evidence that they were dictated by Henry
himself. But the correspondence, still preserved, is too voluminous
for us to believe that he dictated more of the letters than such as
were most important or most interesting to himself. Still it must be
borne in mind, that we have indisputable evidence of Henry having

bears at the same time incidental testimony to Henry's condescending
and kind attention to his old comrade in arms. Sir Hugh was the
Lieutenant of Harfleur, and Henry had himself sent him an account of
the happy issue of his struggle.... He ascribes it to the providence
of the Creator that Henry had concluded a perpetual peace between two
realms which ever, out of mind of any chroniclers, had been at
dissension; and had brought to an end what no man had hitherto
wrought; "thanking God," he continues, "with meek heart, that he hath
sent me that grace to abide the time for to see it, as for the
greatest gladness and consolation that ever came into my heart; not
dreading in myself that He who hath sent you that grace in so short a

<b>Footnote 206:</b> On this subject, T.D. Hardy, Esq. in his Introduction to
the Charter Rolls, just published by the Record Commission, gives the
following clear and satisfactory information:&mdash;Until the 9th of April
1420, Henry V. styled himself in his charters and on his great seal,
"Henricus Dei gratia Rex Angliæ et Franciæ et Dominus Hiberniæ" And on
the Norman Roll of the fifth year of his reign he is sometimes styled
Duke of Normandy, in conjunction with his other titles, as "Henry par
le grace de Dieu, Roy de Fraunce et d'Engleterre, Seigneur de Irlande,
et Duc de Normandie." On the above 9th of April he relinquished the
title of King of France during the life-time of his father-in-law,
Charles, preliminary to the treaty of Troyes, which was signed the
21st of May, 1420; and during the remainder of his life he styled
himself, "Henricus Dei gratia Rex Angliæ, Heres et Regens Franciæ, et
Dominus Hiberniæ."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding an article in the agreement of the 9th of April, that
during the life of Charles, Henry V. should not assume the title of
King of France; yet within ten days he issued a precept from Rouen
relative to the Norman coinage, upon one side of which was to be
inscribed, "Henricus Francorum Rex." As Henry had not then signed the
article of peace at Troyes, it did not perhaps occur to him that he
was thus breaking his agreement with France.&mdash;Rot. Chart.

God. A similar feeling of love for the holy men of God, whether he
could testify that love to the living, or merely record it for the
memory of the dead, might have led him to the installation of the
Bishop of Lincoln, and to the tomb of John of Bridlington and John of
Beverley. Henry was not a Protestant by profession; but, compared with
the hierarchy by whom he was surrounded, he approached almost, if not

<b>Footnote 248:</b> The attachment of Henry to the See of Rome, and the
countenance given by him to the encroachments of the Pope, have been
greatly exaggerated. Rapin took a different view of his measures. "The
proclamation" (he says) "made by Henry, prohibiting the Pope's
provisions, was a death-blow to the court of Rome." On the death of
Henry, the Pope wrote a letter of condolence to the council, in which
he says, "We loved our son of famous memory, Henry King of England,
for there were many and royal virtues in that Prince for which he
ought to be loved;" and then adds a strong appeal to the council to
abrogate the obnoxious statutes which had so materially entrenched
upon his assumed prerogative. In a letter to Henry himself (Kal. Nov.
xiv. An. iv.) nearly two years before his death, the Pope refers to a
promise made by Henry that he had no desire to curtail the authority
of the Roman See in his new dominions; and also to an undertaking that
he would bring the obnoxious statutes under the notice of his
parliament; and that, "<i>if they could not be supported on honest and
lawful grounds</i>," he would satisfy the Pope in that particular. Surely
these are not the expressions of one who was "the slave of the
Popedom."&mdash;See "Annales Ecclesiastici."<a href="#notetag248">(back)</a></p>

<b>Footnote 250:</b> This view of heresy we find to have been at a very early

Walsingham records, that, three years before Richard II.'s deposition
from the throne, "the Pope wrote to him with a prayer (orans) that he
would assist the prelates of the church in the cause of God, and of
the King himself, and of the kingdom, against the Lollards; whom he
declared to be traitors, not only of the church, but of the throne.

<b>Footnote 251:</b> For Christians of the present age, and in our country,
to pass through life without partaking in any persecution, such as
once disgraced our legislature and the executive government, does not
necessarily imply a freedom of the conscience from a persecuting
spirit. The Christian can now evince the real tone and temper of his
mind only in his behaviour towards his fellow-creatures, and by the
sentiments to which he gives utterance. The Author hopes he may be
pardoned, if he ventures, in further illustration of his principles on
this subject, to make an extract from his sermon lately preached at
the consecration of the Bishop of Salisbury. "In his intercourse with
those Christians whose sentiments do not coincide with our own, the
Christian minister will never by laxity of expression or conduct
encourage in any an indifference to truth and error, nor countenance
the insidious workings of latitudinarian principles. He will ever
maintain the truth, but never with acrimony; and, whilst his duty
compels him to banish and drive away all false doctrine, he will feel
and show towards the persons of such as are in error compassionate
indulgence and forbearing tenderness. He knows that truth can be only
on one side, but he acknowledges that sincerity may be on both; and he
will set his mind on winning back again by mild argument and
conciliatory conduct those who have gone astray, rather than by
severity in exposing their faults, and a cold, forbidding, and hostile
bearing, indispose them to examine their mistaken views, and confirm
them in their spirit of alienation."<a href="#notetag251">(back)</a></p>

<b>Footnote 255:</b> Much doubt and many mistakes seem to have prevailed as
to the real state of the law in England before the statute 2 Hen. IV.
cap. 15. It is said by the annotator on Fitzherbert that, "before the
time of Henry IV. no person had been put to death for opinions in
religion in England;" but the same author himself tells us that, among
the crimes to be punished by burning by the common law, heresy is
enumerated. "No Bishop, indeed, by the common law, could convict of
heresy, as to loss of life, but only as to penance, and for the health
of the soul, 'pro salute animæ.' In the case of life, the conviction
by the common law ought to have been before the Archbishop in

<b>Footnote 287:</b> Walsingham (as quoted by Milner) says that the
Archbishop applied to the King for a respite for fifty days for Lord
Cobham. "If this be so," Milner says, "the motives of Arundel can be
no great mystery. It was thought expedient to employ a few weeks in
lessening his credit among the people by a variety of scandalous
aspersions;" Milner then quotes the forged recantation, of which we
speak in a subsequent note. It did not occur to that writer, that the
space of fifty days might be required to forward his appeal to Rome,
and receive the Pope's judgment upon it.<a href="#notetag287">(back)</a></p>

<b>Footnote 288:</b> Soon after the affair of St. Giles' Field much pains
seem to have been taken to discover the retreat of Cobham. The Pell
Rolls, February 19, 1414, record payments to constables and others for
their careful watch and endeavours to take him; and "chiefly for
having found and seized certain books of the Lollards in the house of
a parchment-maker;" and one hundred shillings as an especial reward
"for the great pains and diligence exercised by Thomas Burton, (the
King's spy,) for his attentive watchfulness to the operations of the
Lollards now <i>lately rebellious</i>; also because he fully certified
<i>their intentions</i> to the King for his advantage." This document (for
ignorance of which no former historian may deserve blame, though its
existence should caution every one against drawing hasty conclusions
from negative evidence,) proves that at the Exchequer the Lollards
were considered as having been lately rebellious, and as having had
designs against the King. In a deed too, signed and sealed by the
tenants of Lord Powis, who themselves took Lord Cobham, both heresy
and treason are specified as the crimes of which he had been convicted
"that was miscreant and unbuxom to the law of God, and <i>traitor
convict</i> to our most gracious sovereign and his." The Patent Rolls
record grants of ten pounds per annum to John de Burgh, carpenter,
because he had discovered and delivered up certain Lollards. There are

<b>Footnote 293:</b> Any reference to the opinions of past writers would be
imperfect which should omit Fuller's; he had access, it should seem,
to little if any other data than Fox supplied him with, and yet the
conclusion to which he came is this: "For mine own part, I must
confess myself so lost in the intricacies of these relations, that I
know not what to assent to. On the one side, I am loath to load the
Lord Cobham's memory with causeless crimes, knowing the perfect hatred
the clergy in that age bare unto him, and all that looked towards the
reformation in religion. Besides, that twenty thousand men should be
brought into the field, and no place assigned whence they should have
been raised,<a id="notetag293-a" name="notetag293-a"></a><a
href="#note293-a">[293-a]</a> or where mustered, is clogged with much
improbability, the rather because only the three persons as is
aforesaid are mentioned by name of so vast a number.</p>

<p>"On the other side (continues Fuller), I am much startled with the
evidence which appeareth against him. Indeed I am little moved with
what T. Walsingham writes, (whom all later authors follow, as a flock
the bell-wether,) knowing him a Benedictine monk of St. Alban's, bowed
by interest to partiality; but the records in the Tower, and acts of
parliament therein, wherein he was solemnly condemned for a traitor as
well as a heretic, challenge belief. For with what confidence can any
private person promise credit from posterity to his own writings if
such public documents be not entertained by him for authentical? Let
Mr. Fox therefore be Lord Cobham's compurgator; I dare not. And, if my
hand were put on the Bible, I should take it back again; yet so that,
as I will not acquit, I will not condemn him, but leave all to the
last day of the revelation of the righteous judgment of
God."&mdash;Fuller's Church History, An. 1414.<a href="#notetag293">(back)</a></p></div>

capture of Sir John Oldcastle. There is also payment for the capture
of certain of his clerks and servants. He was taken near Broniarth in
Montgomeryshire, on a property now belonging to Mr. Ormsby Gore, among
whose muniments there is said to be traditionary evidence that the
manor of Broniarth was granted to one of its former possessors as a
reward for securing Sir John Oldcastle. The place in which he is said
to have been taken, is called "Lord Cobham's Field" to this day.</p>

state they had expended twenty shillings about the burning of John
Claydon, skinner, and George Gurmyn, baker, Lollards convicted of
heresy. The Author has searched the records in St. Paul's Cathedral,

<p>"The King to the Mayor and Sheriffs of London, greeting. Whereas the
venerable father, Thomas, Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of all
England, and Legate of the Apostolic See, with the consent and assent
of the Bishop and his brothers, the suffragans, and also of the whole
clergy of his province in his provincial council assembled, the orders
of law in this behalf requisite being in all things observed, by his
definitive sentence pronounced and declared W. Sautre (some time
chaplain, condemned for heresy, by him the said W. heretofore in form
of law abjured, and him the said W. relapsed again into the said
heresy) a manifest heretic, and decreed him to be degraded; and hath
for that cause really degraded him from all clerical prerogative and
privilege; and hath decreed him the said W. to be left, and hath
really left him, to the secular court, according to the laws and
canonical sanctions set forth in this behalf; and holy mother, the
church, hath nothing further to do in the premises. We, therefore,
being zealous for justice, and a lover of the Catholic faith, willing
to maintain and defend holy church, and the rights and liberties
thereof; and, as much as in us lies, to extirpate by the roots such
heresies and errors out of our kingdom of England, and to punish
heretics so convicted with condign punishment; and being mindful that
such heretics, convicted in form aforesaid, and condemned according to
law, divine and human, by canonical institutes on and in this behalf
accustomed, ought to be burnt with a burning flame of fire; we command
you most strictly as we can, firmly enjoining, that you commit to the
fire the aforesaid W. being in your custody, in some public and open
place within the liberties of the city aforesaid, before the people
publicly, by reason of the premises, and cause him really to be burnt
in the same fire in detestation of this crime, and to the manifest
example of other Christians. And this you are by no means to omit

<p>But by the statute of Henry IV. c. 15, it is enacted that every Bishop
in his diocese may convict a man of heresy, and abjure him, and

<b>Footnote 318:</b> The Author on the whole is rather disposed to think
that, whilst the Monk records accurately what fell within his own
knowledge, both he and the author of the Sloane MS. in this part
borrowed from some common document, probably more than one; for in
some points they vary from each other in a way best reconciled by that
supposition. Thus, whilst the Sloane MS. tells us that Richard II. on
his landing came to a place <i>called Cardech</i>, from which he started
for Conway, the Monk (not differing from him in other points) says
that he came to the castle of Hertlowli. They both have fallen into
the error of making the Earl of Salisbury accompany Richard, whereas
he had undoubtedly been sent on before from Dublin to Conway. They are
both equally wrong about the relative positions of Flint and Conway,
and make the parties all cross and recross <i>the bridge</i> at the castle
of Conway, where a noble suspension bridge is now thrown over the arm
of the sea. After the period, however, at which the Monk's narrative
